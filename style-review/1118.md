# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1118

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1118.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Wrong statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem marked SOLVED but the statement is incorrect (asserts all functions are bounded), which is false. The actual problem about level sets with finite measure hasn't been properly formalized.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Incorrect statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem entire_function_level_set_measure :
       ∀ (f : ℂ → ℂ), ∃ (M : ℝ), ∀ z : ℂ, ‖f z‖ ≤ M := by
   ```
   This asserts all functions ℂ → ℂ are bounded, which is false. The actual problem should involve a hypothesis about level sets having finite measure, then conclude something about growth.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (SOLVED).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   The inline comment "Entire functions with finite measure level sets have bounded growth" suggests the right idea, but there's no docstring.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Growth rate of entire functions with finite measure level sets" without explaining the result.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Real is not obviously used.

6. **Missing measure theory** - ℹ️
   Should involve measure theory imports/concepts to talk about level sets with finite measure.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1118)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category for solved problem
- ✅ Correct AMS 30 for analysis
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate statement correctly: add hypothesis about finite measure level sets, then conclude appropriate growth bound.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Convert inline comment to proper theorem docstring.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the relationship between level set measures and growth.

**Priority 5:** Add measure theory concepts to properly formalize "finite measure level sets".

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization has an incorrect statement that doesn't match the problem description. Needs reformulation with proper hypothesis about level set measures.
