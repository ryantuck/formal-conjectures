# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1118

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1118.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of a solved result about entire function level set measures. Properly uses statement form with measure theory.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (SOLVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Camera 1977, Gol'dberg 1979)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1118)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset MeasureTheory` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts implication)
- ✅ Proper use of measure theory (volume, Integrable)
- ✅ Clean use of supremum and logarithms
- ✅ Good formalization with non-constant function constraint

## Recommendations

None. Excellent formalization combining complex analysis and measure theory.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper integration of measure theory concepts in complex analysis.
