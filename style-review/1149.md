# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1149

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1149.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Well-documented, sophisticated formalization

## Summary
Sophisticated formalization of a proved result involving natural density, with excellent documentation and proper mathematical structure.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Theorem docstring in file vs above theorem** - ℹ️
   The comprehensive explanation appears in the file docstring (Lines 35-36) rather than as a separate `/-- ... -/` comment above the theorem. While this is acceptable, standard practice is to have both:
   - File docstring: brief overview
   - Theorem docstring: detailed explanation

   Current structure is fine but slightly non-standard.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent reference URL
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1149)
- ✅ Proper imports including Nat
- ✅ Clear statement using Tendsto and limits
- ✅ **Correct category** (research solved) matching PROVED status
- ✅ Correct AMS 11 (Number theory)
- ✅ **Outstanding documentation:**
  - Explains what the theorem states
  - Mentions it's been proved (Bergelson and Richter)
  - States the exact density value (6/π²)
  - Explains the conditions (non-integer α > 0)
- ✅ Sophisticated mathematical content:
  - Natural density formulation
  - Proper use of Filter.atTop
  - Topological neighborhoods (𝓝 d)
  - Floor function notation (⌊·⌋₊)
  - Finset filtering
- ✅ Statement form correctly used (not question form)
- ✅ No misuse of answer elaborator
- ✅ Clean type coercions and explicit conditions

## Why This is Excellent

This formalization exemplifies best practices:
1. **Clear mathematical content** - The density formula is explicit
2. **Proper attribution** - Credits Bergelson and Richter
3. **Complete conditions** - States α > 0 and α ≠ m for any integer m
4. **Correct status markers** - PROVED status matches `research solved` category
5. **Sophisticated but readable** - Uses advanced concepts (Tendsto, Filter) correctly

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Consider moving the detailed explanation from line 35-36 to a separate theorem docstring for consistency with other problems. Current format is fine though.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is a model formalization that other problems should emulate. Well-documented, mathematically sophisticated, and properly attributed. Only trivial improvement would be docstring organization.
