# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1133

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1133.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Sorry in type position and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem about polynomial bounds with incomplete statement. Issues with sorry in type and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 43)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   ∃ (y : Fin n → ℝ),
     (∀ i, y i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) ∧
     sorry := by
   ```
   The second property that y should satisfy is just `sorry`, making the statement incomplete.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what property the polynomials should have.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Existence of polynomials with large bounds" without explaining what bounds.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1133)
- ✅ Correct imports
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 41
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Good parameter structure with C and positivity
- ✅ Uses Filter.atTop for eventually
- ✅ Existence of ε > 0
- ✅ Universal quantification over point sets
- ✅ Good use of Set.Icc for interval constraints
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Complete the statement by replacing `sorry` with the actual property y should satisfy (likely involving large bounds or polynomial evaluation).

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what existence result is being asserted.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what "large bounds" means in this context.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization has good structure but is incomplete with sorry in the type. Needs completion of the statement to be meaningful.
