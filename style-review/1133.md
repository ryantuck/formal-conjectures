# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1133

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1133.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of an open problem about polynomial bounds. Uses statement form correctly (not answer elaborator) since it asserts existence rather than asking a question.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1133)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset Filter` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 41` for approximation theory)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts existence of epsilon)
- ✅ Proper use of Filter.atTop and eventually
- ✅ Clean formalization with proper quantification
- ✅ Good use of ceiling function and real/nat conversions

## Recommendations

None. This is an excellent formalization of an approximation theory problem.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of polynomial approximation problems with asymptotic conditions.
