# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1162

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1162.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential quantification

## Summary
Asymptotic formula for number of subgroups of S_n. Uses existential quantification making it trivially true.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 41-43)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem subgroups_symmetric_group_asymptotic :
       ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ),
         (fun n => Real.log (f n)) ~[atTop] (fun n => (1/16 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ)^2) := by
   ```

   This is trivially satisfiable. For example, take f(n) = ⌈e^((n²/16))⌉.

   **Should define:** f(n) should be defined as the actual number of subgroups of S_n, not existentially quantified.

2. **Not using question format** - ⚠️
   The problem is marked OPEN, suggesting the refined formula isn't fully established.
   Consider whether this should use `answer(sorry) ↔` format.

3. **Missing definition of f(n)** - ❌
   The docstring says "Let f(n) denote the number of subgroups..." but this is never formally defined.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good documentation with historical context (Pyber, Roney-Dougal & Tracey)
- ✅ Uses asymptotic notation correctly: `~[atTop]`
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Define f(n) properly as the count of subgroups of S_n:
```lean
-- Would need definition or axiomatization
def subgroupCount (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
```

**Priority 2:** Remove existential and use proper definition:
```lean
theorem subgroups_symmetric_group_asymptotic :
    (fun n => Real.log (subgroupCount n)) ~[atTop]
    (fun n => (1/16 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ)^2) := by
  sorry
```

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - The existential over f makes the statement trivially true. Need proper definition of subgroup count.
