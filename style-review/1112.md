## Summary
Well-formalized question about lacunary sequences and sumset gaps. Correctly uses answer elaborator for a yes/no question with a custom definition for k-fold sumset.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects

- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1112)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset Filter` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Bespoke definition `kSumset` with clear docstring
- ✅ Theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct - asks "Does there exist r...")
- ✅ Clean use of `StrictMono`, `Disjoint`, and `Set.range`
- ✅ Proper parameter constraints

## Recommendations

None. Excellent example of formalizing an existence question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper use of answer elaborator for existence questions with custom definitions.
