# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1112

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1112.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Sorry in type position and incomplete formalization

## Summary
Stub formalization with critical issue: theorem statement contains sorry in type position, making it a placeholder.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem lacunary_sumset_gaps :
       ∃ (A : Set ℕ), sorry := by
   ```
   The theorem statement is incomplete. The type of property A should satisfy is just `sorry`.

2. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what the theorem states or what property A should have.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Lacunary sequences and sumset gaps" without explaining what question is being asked.

4. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1112)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully (only because sorry is allowed)

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Complete the theorem statement by replacing `sorry` with the actual property about lacunary sequences and sumset gaps.

**Priority 2:** Add theorem docstring explaining what properties are being asserted.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what lacunary sequences are and what the problem asks.

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

**Priority 5:** Consider adding definitions for "lacunary" and related concepts.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization is incomplete with sorry in a type position. This is a placeholder that needs substantial work to become a proper formalization.
