# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1099

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1099.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Incomplete definition (sorry)

## Summary
Problem formalization with critical issues: the core definition `h` is unimplemented (`sorry`). While the file builds and follows most structural conventions, it is mathematically empty.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Sorry in definition (Line 31)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def h (α : ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ := sorry
   ```
   The core mathematical definition for this problem is unimplemented. This makes the theorem statement mathematically meaningless.

2. **Missing Basic API** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   There are no lemmas or theorems provided to test or clarify the behavior of the custom definition `h`.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   The file docstring "Bound on h_α(n) for divisor gaps" is very brief and does not explain the mathematical context or the definition of $h_\alpha(n)$.

4. **Potentially unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 25: `open Finset` - `Finset` does not appear to be used in the current file content.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (`Erdos1099`)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports (`FormalConjectures.Util.ProblemImports`)
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Theorem docstring present
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Implement the definition of `h`. For problem 1099, this should involve the gaps between divisors of $n$.

**Priority 2:** Add a basic API for `h` (e.g., values for small $n$ or basic properties) to ensure the definition is correct.

**Priority 3:** Expand the file docstring to explain what $h_\alpha(n)$ represents.

**Priority 4:** Remove the unused `open Finset` if it is indeed not needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization is incomplete due to the use of `sorry` in the primary definition. This must be addressed to provide a meaningful formal statement.
