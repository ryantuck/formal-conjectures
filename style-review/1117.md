# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1117

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1117.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized open question about maximum points on circles for entire functions. Correctly uses answer elaborator for the existence question.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1117)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct - asks "Does there exist...")
- ✅ Proper use of entire function properties
- ✅ Clean use of Nat.card and supremum
- ✅ Good exclusion of trivial case (non-monomial)

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization of an existence question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper use of answer elaborator for existence questions in complex analysis.
