# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1117

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1117.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Trivial statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem formalization where the statement is trivially true (merely asserts circles are non-empty), suggesting the actual problem hasn't been captured.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Trivial statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem entire_functions_circle_maxima :
       ∀ (f : ℂ → ℂ) (r : ℝ), 0 < r → ∃ (z : ℂ), ‖z‖ = r := by
   ```
   This statement is trivially true (for any r > 0, there exists z with ‖z‖ = r, independent of f). The actual problem about maximum points of entire functions on circles is not captured.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what should be proven about entire functions and circle maxima.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Maximum points on circles for entire functions" without explaining the actual question.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Real is not obviously used.

6. **Missing function constraint** - ℹ️
   Should specify that f is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere), and relate z to maximum of |f| on the circle.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1117)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate the statement to capture the actual problem about where entire functions achieve their maximum on circles.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what is being asked about entire functions.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the question about maximum points on circles.

**Priority 5:** Add constraint that f is entire (possibly via a predicate or type) and relate the existence to maxima of |f|.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization's statement is trivial and doesn't capture the actual mathematical problem. Needs reformulation to properly express the question about entire functions and their maxima on circles.
