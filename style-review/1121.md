# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1121

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1121.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** - Complex formalization requiring review

## Summary
Formalization of a proved circle coverage conjecture. Uses statement form correctly for a solved problem, but the no-separating-line condition may need mathematical review.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Complex no-separating-line condition (Lines 43-46)** - ℹ️
   The condition for "no line disjoint from all circles divides them" is formalized using norm inequalities that may not correctly capture the geometric intuition. This should be reviewed by someone familiar with the original problem statement.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (PROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Goodman and Goodman)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1121)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with good docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 52` for convex geometry)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts universal property)
- ✅ Proper use of EuclideanSpace and Metric API
- ✅ Clean use of closedBall and subset relations

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Review the mathematical formalization of the no-separating-line condition to ensure correctness.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** - Style is excellent, but mathematical formalization should be verified.
