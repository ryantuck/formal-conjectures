# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1124

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1124.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized proved result about square and circle decomposition. Properly uses statement form with good geometric formalization.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (PROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Laczkovich)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1124)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring noting translations-only result
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 52` for convex geometry)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts existence)
- ✅ Proper use of EuclideanSpace and set theory
- ✅ Clean let expressions for readability
- ✅ Good formalization of congruence by translation

## Recommendations

None. This is an excellent formalization of a geometric decomposition result.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of geometric results with measure-theoretic flavor.
