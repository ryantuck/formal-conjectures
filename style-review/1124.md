# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1124

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1124.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Trivial statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem marked PROVED but the statement is trivially true (merely asserts existence of some decomposition satisfying True), not capturing the actual result.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Trivial statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem square_circle_decomposition :
       ∃ (n : ℕ) (parts : Fin n → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))), True := by
   ```
   This statement `∃ n parts, True` is trivially true. The actual problem should specify that the square and circle can be decomposed into n congruent parts that can be rearranged from one to the other.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what decomposition result is being proven.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Decomposition of square and circle into congruent parts" without explaining what the proved result states.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Topology is not obviously used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1124)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports including EuclideanSpace
- ✅ Correct category for solved problem
- ✅ Correct AMS 52 for convex and discrete geometry
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate statement to specify: (a) what a square and circle are, (b) that they can be partitioned into n congruent pieces, (c) that these pieces can be rearranged via congruences to transform one shape into the other.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining the equidecomposability result.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the famous result about decomposing a square into a circle.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization has a trivial statement that doesn't capture the substantial geometric result. Needs complete reformulation to express the actual equidecomposability theorem.
