# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1156

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1156.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Vacuous True statements

## Summary
Two theorems about chromatic number concentration in random graphs. Both have vacuous `True` statements.

**Score:** 13/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **First theorem is vacuous (Lines 44-51)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem chromatic_concentration_bounded_range :
       (∃ (C : ℕ), ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
         ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card ≤ C ∧
           ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)), True) ∨ ...
   ```

   The inner `∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)), True` is vacuous. This just says "True for all graphs" which is always True.

   Missing: Any statement about χ(G) being in S.

2. **Second theorem conclusion is just True (Lines 58-62)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem chromatic_resists_concentration :
       ∀ (ω : ℕ → ℝ), ... →
       ∀ (f : ℕ → ℕ), ∃ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
         True := by
   ```

   The conclusion is literally just `True`, which is vacuous.

3. **No theorem docstrings** - ❌
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comments above theorems (though docstrings are in middle of theorem for question context).

4. **Both should use answer elaborator** - ⚠️
   These are questions, so should use `answer(sorry) ↔`.

5. **Unused variable declarations** - ⚠️
   `variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]` not used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Problem descriptions are detailed
- ✅ Two related questions formalized separately
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ Reference URL included

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Replace vacuous `True` statements with actual conditions about chromatic number

**Priority 2:** Add `answer(sorry) ↔` for both questions

**Priority 3:** Move docstrings above theorems

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Both theorems have vacuous `True` conclusions. Need complete rewrite with actual chromatic number conditions.
