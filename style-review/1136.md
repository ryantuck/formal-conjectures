# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1136

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1136.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (minor: missing STATUS line)

## Summary
Outstanding formalization of a solved problem about sumset-free sets with high lower density. Clear statement with proper use of filters.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Minor Issue

1. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ℹ️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1136)
- ✅ Correct imports including Filter
- ✅ Correct category `research solved` with AMS 11
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Clear sumset-free property (a + b ≠ 2^k for all k)
- ✅ Proper use of liminf for lower density
- ✅ Explicit bound > 1/3
- ✅ Good use of Set operations (∩, Icc)
- ✅ Uses ncard for natural number cardinality
- ✅ Clean quantifier structure
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Optional:** Consider adding brief problem description, though the theorem docstring is clear.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is an exemplary formalization with clear mathematical content about sumset-free sets avoiding powers of 2. The use of lower density with explicit bound is well-formulated. Only minor documentation enhancement possible.
