# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1123

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1123.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Uses sorry in type definitions

## Summary
Formalization of a set theory question about Boolean algebra isomorphism. The problem is inherently difficult to formalize without full definitions, leading to `sorry` in type definitions.

**Score:** 19/21 passing

## Issues

### Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in type definitions (Lines 41-42)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   let B1 : Type := sorry
   let B2 : Type := sorry
   ```
   While this is sometimes unavoidable for extremely complex definitions, it reduces the value of the formalization. Consider whether partial definitions could be provided.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included with historical context (Just and Krawczyk 1984, CH dependency)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1123)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring explaining CH dependency
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 03` for set theory)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct - asks about non-isomorphism)
- ✅ Proper use of order isomorphism (≃o)

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Consider whether even incomplete/partial definitions for B1 and B2 could be provided to reduce reliance on `sorry` in types.

**Priority 2:** The file could benefit from a note explaining why full definitions are impractical here.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - While the overall style is good, the use of `sorry` in type definitions is concerning. This may be unavoidable for this particular problem, but should be addressed if possible.
