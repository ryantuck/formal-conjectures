# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1123

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1123.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Trivial statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem formalization where the statement is trivially true (asserts all Boolean algebras have injections to each other), which can't be the intended problem.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Trivial/incorrect statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem boolean_algebra_isomorphism :
       ∀ (α β : Type*) [BooleanAlgebra α] [BooleanAlgebra β], ∃ (f : α → β), Function.Injective f := by
   ```
   This merely asserts that for any two Boolean algebras, there exists an injection from one to the other. This is either trivially true (if one is smaller/embeddable) or false (if incomparable), depending on cardinalities. The actual problem likely asks about specific cardinalities or isomorphism conditions.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what isomorphism property is being asked about.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Boolean algebra isomorphism" without explaining the question.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

6. **Misleading name** - ℹ️
   The theorem name says "isomorphism" but only asserts injection, not bijection or structure preservation.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1123)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct AMS 03 for mathematical logic
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Uses BooleanAlgebra typeclass correctly
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate statement to capture the actual problem (likely about specific cardinalities, or asking about isomorphism rather than injection, or about structure-preserving maps).

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what is being asked.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what Boolean algebra relationship is being studied.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

**Priority 6:** Consider renaming if the final statement is about injection rather than isomorphism.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization's statement doesn't capture meaningful mathematical content. Needs reformulation based on the actual problem requirements.
