# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1168

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1168.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS REVIEW** - Complex formulation

## Summary
Partition relation failure for ℵ_{ω+1}. Statement format is appropriate, but cardinality constraints are missing.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Significant Issues

1. **Missing cardinality constraints** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   theorem partition_relation_fails_aleph_omega_plus_one :
       ∀ (α : Type*) [Infinite α],
       ∀ (gamma : Type*) [Countable gamma],
         PartitionRelationFails α 2 gamma (fun _ => Fin 3 ⊕ α) := by
   ```

   - `α` should have cardinality ℵ_{ω+1}, not just be infinite
   - `gamma` should be countably infinite (ℵ_0), not just countable
   - The problem says "without assuming GCH" but this isn't captured in the statement

2. **Target structure `Fin 3 ⊕ α` is unusual** - ⚠️
   The notation in the problem is "ℵ_{ω+1} ↛ (ℵ_{ω+1}, 3, …, 3)_{ℵ_0}^2"

   This means:
   - Countably many colors
   - Each color c can either admit:
     - A monochromatic set of size ℵ_{ω+1}, OR
     - A monochromatic set of size 3

   The formalization uses `Fin 3 ⊕ α` for all colors. This suggests:
   - Either a 3-element set OR
   - A set of size |α|

   But the original has most colors requiring only size 3, with perhaps one special color allowing ℵ_{ω+1}. The uniform treatment `fun _ => Fin 3 ⊕ α` may not be quite right.

3. **PartitionRelationFails definition** - ✅
   The negation is correctly formulated: there exists a coloring with no monochromatic set of the required size.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ **Correct statement format** - States the partition relation fails, appropriate for a negative result
- ✅ Defines PartitionRelationFails clearly
- ✅ Proper category: `research open`
- ✅ AMS 03 (Set theory) is appropriate
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Good docstring mentioning "without assuming GCH"
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add note about missing cardinality constraints:
```lean
-- Note: In the full problem, α would have cardinality ℵ_{ω+1}
-- and gamma would be ℵ_0 (countably infinite). These constraints
-- are not expressible in Lean's type theory without additional axioms.
```

**Priority 2:** Review whether `fun _ => Fin 3 ⊕ α` correctly captures the heterogeneous target structure

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE WITH NOTES** - The structure is reasonable but missing the specific cardinality constraints that distinguish ℵ_{ω+1} from arbitrary infinite types. The target structure may need review.
