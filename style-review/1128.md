# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1128

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1128.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized disproved result about Ramsey properties on ℵ₁. Correctly uses `answer(False)` for a question that has been answered negatively.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (DISPROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Prikry and Mills 1978)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1128)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Topology Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 03` for set theory)
- ✅ **Correct use of `answer(False)`** - This is a disproved statement
- ✅ Proper use of cardinal arithmetic (Cardinal.aleph)
- ✅ Clean formalization of the Ramsey-type question
- ✅ Good mathematical structure with proper quantification

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization showing **correct use of answer(False) for a disproved conjecture**.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - A model formalization demonstrating the proper use of `answer(False)` for disproved conjectures. This should be used as a reference for other disproved problems.
