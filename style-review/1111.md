# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1111

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1111.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of chromatic number and anticomplete vertex sets. Uses statement form correctly for a graph theory problem with universal quantification.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1111)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Topology Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring explaining the problem
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 05` for combinatorics)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts existence of parameter d)
- ✅ Proper use of SimpleGraph API and graph properties
- ✅ Clean formalization with proper type parameters
- ✅ Good use of DecidableEq and DecidableRel

## Recommendations

None. This is a well-crafted formalization of a graph theory problem.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper use of Mathlib's graph theory API and correct formalization approach.
