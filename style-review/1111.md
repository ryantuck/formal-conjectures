# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1111

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1111.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Missing STATUS and unusual statement structure

## Summary
Problem formalization about chromatic numbers and anticomplete sets. Issues with missing STATUS and unusual theorem statement that asserts existence universally.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

2. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what the theorem states.

3. **Unusual statement structure** - ⚠️
   The theorem asserts `∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n))...` but n is an implicit parameter, making this statement potentially unclear. This might be formalized differently as an answer elaborator question.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Chromatic number and anticomplete vertex sets" without explaining the question.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1111)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports for graph theory
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (AMS 05 for combinatorics)
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Uses SimpleGraph and chromaticNumber correctly
- ✅ Clear condition for anticomplete set (no edges between vertices)
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 2:** Add theorem docstring explaining what is being asked.

**Priority 3:** Consider whether this should use answer elaborator pattern, e.g., asking whether such a function f exists.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the relationship between chromatic number and anticomplete sets.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization captures a graph-theoretic property but could benefit from clearer documentation and possibly restructuring the statement for clarity.
