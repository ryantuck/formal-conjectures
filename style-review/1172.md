# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1172

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1172.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial formalization

## Summary
Problem has comprehensive documentation but statement reduces to `True := by sorry` which doesn't formalize the partition relations.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Trivial statement** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem partition_relations_under_gch :
       ∀ (omega_two omega_three : Type*) ...,
         True := by sorry
   ```

   Just proves `True` for all types, doesn't state any partition relation.

2. **Missing PartitionRelation usage** - Unlike 1170 and 1171, doesn't actually use the PartitionRelation definition.

3. **Multiple questions listed** - Docstring lists 4 different questions but theorem proves nothing specific.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent documentation of all 4 questions
- ✅ Proper attribution (Erdős-Hajnal)
- ✅ Notes incomplete source photocopy

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Choose one of the 4 questions and formalize it properly, or formalize the disjunction of all 4.

**Suggested fix:**
```lean
theorem partition_relations_under_gch :
    (∃ omega_two omega_three : Type*, ...) ∨  -- Question 1
    (∃ omega_two omega_three : Type*, ...) ∨  -- Question 2
    ... := by sorry
```

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS SIGNIFICANT WORK** - Currently just `True`, needs actual formalization
