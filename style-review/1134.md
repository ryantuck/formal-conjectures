# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1134

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1134.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Status/category mismatch and answer pattern issues

## Summary
Problem marked DISPROVED but uses `research open` category and has incomplete definition, creating critical inconsistencies.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Status/category mismatch** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   - File docstring says "DISPROVED"
   - But uses `@[category research open, AMS 11]`
   - For a disproved problem, should use `research solved`

2. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 40)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem linear_operation_set_density (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∃ (c : ℝ), 0 < c ∧
         Filter.liminf (fun X => (A ∩ Set.Icc 1 X).ncard / X) Filter.atTop ≥ c := by
   ```
   Uses `answer` as parameter. For a disproved problem, should be:
   ```lean
   theorem linear_operation_set_density :
       answer(False) ↔ ∃ (c : ℝ), 0 < c ∧ ... := by
   ```

3. **Sorry in definition (Line 36)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   def A : Set ℕ := sorry
   ```
   The set A is completely unspecified, making the theorem statement meaningless.

4. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what was disproved.

### Minor Issues

5. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Lower density of a set generated by linear operations" without explaining what was disproved.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1134)
- ✅ Correct imports
- ✅ Uses proper density notation with liminf
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix status/category inconsistency - change to `research solved` if disproved.

**Priority 2:** Fix answer elaborator to use `answer(False)` on LHS for disproved statement.

**Priority 3:** Specify the set A (what linear operations close it).

**Priority 4:** Add theorem docstring explaining what was disproved and ideally citing the counterexample.

**Priority 5:** Expand problem description to explain the original conjecture and its disproof.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization has severe inconsistencies between claimed status (DISPROVED) and structure (open with undefined set). Needs major revision to be coherent.
