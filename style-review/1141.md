# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1141

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1141.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Missing theorem docstring, brief description

## Summary
Clean formalization with proper structure, but lacks a theorem docstring and has minimal problem description.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **No theorem docstring (Line 37)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   @[category research open, AMS 11]
   theorem infinitely_many_n_prime_shift :
   ```
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment above the theorem. Should explain what the theorem states.

2. **Brief problem description (Line 22)** - ℹ️
   File docstring just says "Infinitely many n with property that n-k² is prime for coprime k with k²<n."
   Could be expanded to explain:
   - What makes this problem interesting
   - Any known partial results
   - Connection to other problems

3. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - neither appears to be used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1141)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Clear statement using Set.Infinite
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11
- ✅ Statement form correctly used (not question form)
- ✅ Clean mathematical formulation

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add theorem docstring explaining the mathematical content

**Priority 2:** Expand problem description in file docstring with more context

**Priority 3:** Remove unused imports (Finset, Filter, scoped Topology Real)

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Solid formalization that would benefit from better documentation. The mathematical content is correct but could be more accessible with additional explanation.
