# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1132

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1132.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in multiple positions and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem about Lagrange interpolation bounds with answer elaborator. Issues with sorry in definition, sorry in type, and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in definition (Line 36)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def L {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) (t : ℝ) : ℝ := sorry
   ```
   The key definition is completely unimplemented.

2. **Sorry in type position (Line 44)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   L (seq n) t > (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n - sorry
   ```
   The bound term is incomplete with `sorry`.

3. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 40)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   theorem lagrange_absolute_value_sums (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∀ (seq : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)), ...
   ```
   Uses `answer` as parameter instead of `answer(sorry)` on LHS.

4. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

### Minor Issues

5. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Absolute value sums in Lagrange interpolation" without explaining the question.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Good theorem docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1132)
- ✅ Correct imports including Filter
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 41
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Uses dependent types for sequences (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)
- ✅ Good use of Set.Ioo for open interval
- ✅ Uses eventually notation (∀ᶠ)
- ✅ Definition has docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix answer elaborator pattern - use `answer(sorry)` on LHS.

**Priority 2:** Complete the bound by replacing `sorry` with the actual constant term.

**Priority 3:** Implement or specify the L definition.

**Priority 4:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 5:** Expand problem description to explain the logarithmic bound question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good structure for an open problem but has multiple incomplete parts (definition and bound term) plus answer elaborator pattern issue. Needs completion of sorry terms and pattern fix.
