# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1109

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1109.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Sorry in type position and incomplete formalization

## Summary
Stub formalization with critical issue: theorem statement contains sorry in type position, making it incomplete.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 39)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem squarefree_sumsets :
       ∃ (A B : Set ℕ), (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ B, Squarefree (a + b)) ∧
         sorry := by
   ```
   The theorem statement is incomplete with `sorry` as part of the conjunction, making this a placeholder.

2. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what the theorem states or what the second property should be.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Squarefree sumsets" without explaining what question is being asked.

4. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1109)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully (only because sorry is allowed)
- ✅ Uses Squarefree predicate correctly

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Complete the theorem statement by replacing `sorry` with the actual second property being asserted about sets A and B.

**Priority 2:** Add theorem docstring explaining what properties the sets should have.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what is being asked about squarefree sumsets.

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization is incomplete with sorry in a type position. This is a placeholder that needs completion before it can be considered a proper formalization.
