# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1109

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1109.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-structured formalization of squarefree sumset bounds with a custom definition and three theorems covering lower bound, upper bound, and an open question about subpolynomial growth.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1109)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Bespoke definition `f` with clear docstring
- ✅ Three theorems covering different aspects of the problem
- ✅ Proper theorem docstrings
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Statement form for lower/upper bounds (correct)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` for the open subpolynomial question (correct)
- ✅ Clean use of `Filter.atTop` and asymptotic notation

## Recommendations

None. This is an excellent example of how to handle a problem with multiple related results and a main open question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates best practices for formalizing problems with partial results and custom definitions.
