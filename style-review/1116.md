# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1116

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1116.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Trivial statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem marked SOLVED but the theorem statement is trivial (asserts all functions are defined everywhere), suggesting the actual problem hasn't been properly formalized.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Trivial statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem meromorphic_root_distribution :
       ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), ∀ z : ℂ, ∃ w : ℂ, f z = w := by
   ```
   This statement is trivially true (every function satisfies `∀ z, ∃ w, f z = w`). The actual problem about meromorphic functions and root distribution is not captured.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (SOLVED).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what should be proven about meromorphic functions.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Meromorphic functions and root distribution" without explaining the actual problem.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

6. **Missing definitions** - ℹ️
   Should define or import "meromorphic" and specify what "root distribution" property is being asserted.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1116)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category for solved problem
- ✅ Correct AMS 30 for analysis
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate the statement to capture the actual problem about meromorphic functions and their root distribution.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining the result about meromorphic functions.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what the solved problem actually states.

**Priority 5:** Consider adding definition or constraint for meromorphic functions.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization appears incomplete. The trivial statement suggests the actual mathematical content hasn't been properly captured. Needs reformulation to match the intended problem.
