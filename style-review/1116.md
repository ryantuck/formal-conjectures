**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1116.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of a solved result about meromorphic functions and root distribution. Correctly uses statement form with proper historical attribution.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (SOLVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Gol'dberg and Toppila)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1116)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts existence)
- ✅ Proper use of complex analysis and cardinality
- ✅ Clean use of limsup and extended reals (EReal)
- ✅ Let expressions for readability
