# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1106

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1106.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and wrong reference

## Summary
Good formalization with two related theorems about prime factors of partition number products. Issues with copyright year and incorrect reference URL.

**Score:** 17/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Wrong reference URL (Line 21)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   *Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1064](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1106)
   ```
   The link text says 1064 but URL says 1106. Should be:
   ```lean
   *Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1106](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1106)
   ```

3. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only has the reference, no description of what the problem asks.

5. **Missing definition docstring** - ℹ️
   Line 30: The `p` function definition has a docstring, but it's complex enough that it could be clearer.

6. **Notation inconsistency** - ℹ️
   Uses `#` for cardinality via notation, which should work but could be documented.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Good structure with two related theorems
- ✅ Clear theorem docstrings with mathematical notation
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1106)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Both theorems marked `research open` with AMS 11
- ✅ Good use of Fintype.card for partition counting
- ✅ Second theorem is a stronger version (F(n) > n)
- ✅ Proper use of filters (atTop, ∀ᶠ)
- ✅ Uses Finset operations (Icc, ∏)
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Fix reference link text to match URL (both should be 1106).

**Priority 3:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 4:** Add brief problem description in file docstring.

**Priority 5:** Consider clarifying the definition of p(n) or adding a note about Nat.Partition.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good mathematical formalization with clear related results. Needs copyright fix and reference correction, plus enhanced docstring.
