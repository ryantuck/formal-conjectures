# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1107

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1107.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and missing STATUS

## Summary
Excellent formalization with main theorem and solved variant. Good definition structure. Issues with copyright year and missing STATUS in docstring.

**Score:** 19/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line. Since main theorem is open but there's a solved variant, could say "OPEN (partial results)".

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only has references, no description of what the problem asks.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent structure with main theorem and solved variant
- ✅ Comprehensive file docstring with multiple references including specific paper
- ✅ Good helper definition `SumOfRPowerful` with clear docstring
- ✅ Clear theorem docstrings with mathematical notation
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1107)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Main theorem marked `research open`, variant marked `research solved`
- ✅ Both use AMS 11
- ✅ Good attribution to Heath-Brown [He88] for the solved case
- ✅ Proper quantifier structure (∀ r ≥ 2)
- ✅ Good use of filters (∀ᶠ, atTop)
- ✅ Uses Nat.Full for r-powerful numbers
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring (e.g., "OPEN (r=2 solved)").

**Priority 3:** Add brief problem description explaining what r-powerful numbers are and what the problem asks.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Excellent formalization with clear main result and important special case. Only needs copyright fix and enhanced docstring. The mathematical structure is well-organized.
