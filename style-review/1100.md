# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1100

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1100.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Non-standard answer elaborator and sorry in type position

## Summary
Problem formalization with critical issues: uses non-standard answer elaborator pattern and has sorry in type position. Brief problem description.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 43)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem coprime_consecutive_divisors (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => (τ_perp n : ℝ) / omega n) atTop atTop ∧
         (∀ n, (τ_perp n : ℝ) < Real.exp ((Real.log (n : ℝ)) ^ ((1 : ℝ)/2))) := by
   ```
   The answer elaborator should be `answer(sorry)` on the RHS, not `answer` as a parameter. This is not a yes/no question, it's a statement asking whether a property holds.

   Should be (if this is a statement):
   ```lean
   theorem coprime_consecutive_divisors :
       Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => (τ_perp n : ℝ) / omega n) atTop atTop ∧
         (∀ n, (τ_perp n : ℝ) < Real.exp ((Real.log (n : ℝ)) ^ ((1 : ℝ)/2))) := by
   ```

2. **Sorry in type position (Line 39)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def τ_perp (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
   ```
   The definition is completely unimplemented. While definitions can have sorry, this indicates the formalization is incomplete.

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   The main theorem lacks a docstring explaining what it states.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Properties of τ⊥(n) - coprime consecutive divisors" without explaining what the problem asks.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Topology is not used in the file.

6. **Missing definition docstring** - ℹ️
   Line 36: `omega` definition lacks a docstring (though it has an inline comment).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1100)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the answer elaborator pattern - either remove the parameter and use standard statement form, or use `answer(sorry) ↔` on RHS if this is truly a question.

**Priority 2:** Implement the `τ_perp` definition or at least provide a clearer specification.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining the mathematical statement.

**Priority 4:** Expand the problem description to explain what is being asked.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused `Topology` import or add documentation why it's needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization has serious structural problems with the answer elaborator pattern and incomplete definitions. These need to be fixed before the formalization can be considered complete.
