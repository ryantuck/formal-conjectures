# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1146

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1146.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - `sorry` on RHS of answer elaborator

## Summary
Minimal formalization with `sorry` as the entire right-hand side of the equivalence, providing no mathematical content.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Issues

### Priority Issues

1. **`sorry` as entire RHS (Line 38)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem powers_two_three_essential (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ sorry := by
   ```

   The RHS should contain the actual mathematical proposition. Should be something like:
   ```lean
   theorem powers_two_three_essential (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ IsEssentialComponent {n | ∃ m k, n = 2^m * 3^k} := by
   ```

   Also uses non-standard `(answer : Prop)` parameter pattern (see problem 1144).

2. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment explaining what "essential component" means in this context.

3. **Minimal problem description (Line 22)** - ⚠️
   "Is B = {2^m3^n : m,n ≥ 0} an essential component?" doesn't explain:
   - What an "essential component" means
   - Essential component of what?
   - Why this set is interesting
   - Context of the problem

4. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

5. **Missing definition** - ⚠️
   Should define what "essential component" means, similar to how problem 1140 defines `satisfiesCondition`.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1146)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11
- ✅ Question form appropriately used

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Define "essential component" and complete the RHS with the actual proposition

**Priority 2:** Expand problem description to explain the concept and context

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports

**Priority 5:** Consider using standard `answer(sorry)` pattern instead of `(answer : Prop)` parameter

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - The formalization has the right structure but lacks mathematical content. The RHS is just `sorry` which provides no information about what the problem asks.
