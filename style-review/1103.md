# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1103

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1103.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of growth rate bounds for sequences with squarefree sumsets. The file correctly uses statement form (no answer elaborator needed) for the open problems, since they assert the existence of bounds rather than asking a question.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Comprehensive file docstring with STATUS line
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1103)
- ✅ Both `open Finset Filter` and `open scoped Real` correctly used
- ✅ Two theorems representing lower and upper bounds on growth rate
- ✅ Excellent theorem docstrings explaining the mathematical content
- ✅ Proper category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Correct use of statement form (no answer elaborator needed)
- ✅ Clean mathematical formalization using `atTop`, `∀ᶠ`, and real exponents
- ✅ One problem per file
- ✅ Proper directory structure

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - A model formalization demonstrating best practices for open problems with established partial results. The file correctly separates the lower and upper bound results into two theorems.
