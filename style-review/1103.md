# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1103

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1103.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Sorry in type position and incomplete formalization

## Summary
Stub formalization with critical issues: theorem statement contains sorry in type position, making the formalization incomplete.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem squarefree_sumset_growth :
       ∃ (A : ℕ → Finset ℕ), sorry := by
   ```
   The theorem statement is incomplete. The type of what should be proven is just `sorry`, making this a placeholder rather than a proper formalization.

2. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what the theorem states.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Growth rate of sequences with squarefree sumsets" without explaining what is being asked.

4. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

5. **Incomplete formalization** - ⚠️
   The theorem name suggests it's about growth rates, but the statement only asserts existence without any growth condition.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1103)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Complete the theorem statement by replacing `sorry` with the actual property being proven.

**Priority 2:** Add theorem docstring explaining what growth rate property is being asserted.

**Priority 3:** Expand the problem description to explain what question is being asked about squarefree sumsets.

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

**Priority 5:** Consider adding definitions for "squarefree sumset" and related concepts.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization is incomplete with sorry in a type position. This is essentially a placeholder that needs substantial work to become a proper formalization.
