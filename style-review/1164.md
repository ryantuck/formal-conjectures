# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1164

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1164.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential

## Summary
Random walk coverage problem. Result is stated but the existential over R makes it trivially true.

**Score:** 17/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 46-50)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem random_walk_coverage_radius :
       ∃ (R : ℕ → ℝ), ∃ (C₁ C₂ : ℝ), C₁ > 0 ∧ C₂ > 0 ∧
         ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
           C₁ * Real.sqrt (Real.log n) ≤ Real.log (R n) ∧
           Real.log (R n) ≤ C₂ * Real.sqrt (Real.log n) := by
   ```

   This is trivially satisfied by taking R n = e^(C * √(log n)) for any constant C > 0,
   then choosing C₁ and C₂ appropriately.

   **Should define:** R_n should be defined based on the actual random walk process (with high probability, visits all points with norm ≤ R_n within n steps).

2. **Missing probabilistic formulation** - ❌
   The docstring mentions "with high probability" but there's no probability in the statement.
   Random walk, probability measures, and "w.h.p." are all absent.

3. **Status is SOLVED** - ⚠️
   For a solved problem with an established result, we shouldn't use existential quantification.
   The statement should directly assert the result for the properly defined R_n.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good documentation with attribution (Révész, Kesten, Dembo et al.)
- ✅ Uses asymptotic notation: `∀ᶠ ... in atTop`
- ✅ Proper category: `research solved`
- ✅ AMS 60 (Probability) is appropriate
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Define R_n based on the actual random walk (requires probability infrastructure):
```lean
-- Would need random walk definition and probability
def coverageRadius (n : ℕ) : ℝ := sorry
```

**Priority 2:** Include "with high probability" in the formalization, or note its absence in a comment

**Priority 3:** Remove existential over R and use the defined coverage radius

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - The existential makes it trivially true. Missing the probabilistic aspect of the original problem.
