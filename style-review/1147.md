# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1147

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1147.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT** - Status says DISPROVED but category is "research open"

## Summary
Minimal formalization with inconsistency between declared status (DISPROVED) and category attribute (research open), plus `sorry` as entire RHS.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Issues

### Priority Issues

1. **Inconsistent status and category (Lines 24, 36)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   # File docstring says: DISPROVED
   ...
   @[category research open, AMS 11]
   ```

   If the problem is DISPROVED, the category should be `research solved` and the answer elaborator should use a concrete value (likely `False`).

2. **`sorry` as entire RHS (Line 38)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem irrational_quadratic_approximation_basis (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ sorry := by
   ```

   The RHS should contain the actual mathematical proposition about additive basis.
   If DISPROVED, should be `answer(False) ↔ (the actual proposition)`.

3. **Non-standard answer pattern (Line 37)** - ℹ️
   Uses `(answer : Prop)` parameter instead of standard `answer(sorry)` elaborator.

4. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment explaining what the theorem states.

5. **Minimal problem description (Line 22)** - ⚠️
   "Additive basis question for irrational quadratic approximations" doesn't explain:
   - What the additive basis is
   - What irrational quadratic approximations means
   - What the specific question asks
   - Why it was disproved

6. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1147)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ AMS 11 code present

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the inconsistency:
   - If DISPROVED: change to `category research solved` and use `answer(False)`
   - If actually OPEN: change file docstring from DISPROVED to OPEN

**Priority 2:** Complete the RHS with the actual mathematical proposition

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what was disproved and how

**Priority 4:** Add theorem docstring

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports

**Priority 6:** Use standard answer elaborator pattern

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT** - Major inconsistency between declared status and category attribute, plus incomplete mathematical content. Needs clarification and proper formalization.
