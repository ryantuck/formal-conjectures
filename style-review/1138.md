# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1138

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1138.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized open question about primes near maximum gaps. Correctly uses answer elaborator for a question asking "is it true that...".

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1138)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset Filter` and `open scoped Topology Real`
- ✅ Bespoke definition `d` for maximum prime gap with clear docstring
- ✅ Single theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct - asks "is it true that...")
- ✅ Proper use of Nat.primeCounting
- ✅ Clean formalization of asymptotic formula
- ✅ Good use of Filter.Tendsto

## Recommendations

None. This is an excellent formalization of a prime number theory question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of number theory problems with custom definitions and asymptotic analysis.
