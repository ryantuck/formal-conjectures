# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1138

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1138.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in definitions and unusual statement

## Summary
Problem about primes near maximum gaps with structure issues. Two definitions are unimplemented, and the statement structure is unusual.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in definitions (Lines 36, 39)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def primePi (x : ℝ) : ℕ := sorry
   noncomputable def d (x : ℝ) : ℕ := sorry
   ```
   Both key definitions are completely unimplemented. These should ideally be defined or imported from Mathlib.

2. **Unusual statement structure** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   theorem primes_near_max_gaps (C : ℝ) (hC : 1 < C) (x y : ℝ) (hxy1 : x / 2 < y) (hxy2 : y < x) :
       Tendsto (fun _ : ℕ => ...) atTop (𝓝 1) := by
   ```
   The statement takes parameters C, x, y but then has Tendsto over `ℕ` that doesn't use the parameter. This suggests the formalization may not capture the intended asymptotic behavior.

3. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Asymptotic formula for primes near maximum gaps" without more detail.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Good theorem docstring with mathematical notation
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1138)
- ✅ Correct imports including Filter
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 11
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Definitions have docstrings
- ✅ Uses Tendsto with neighborhood
- ✅ Good real number conversions and logarithm
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Implement or properly specify the primePi and d definitions (or import from Mathlib if available).

**Priority 2:** Review the statement structure - the Tendsto over ℕ that doesn't use the natural number suggests the asymptotic may need reformulation.

**Priority 3:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the asymptotic formula more clearly.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - The formalization has good structure but incomplete definitions and potentially incorrect asymptotic formulation. Needs definition implementation and statement review.
