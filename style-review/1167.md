# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1167

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1167.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - Statement format correct for implication

## Summary
Partition relation implication problem. Uses proper statement format (not question format) for an implication between two partition relations.

**Score:** 19/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **PartitionRelation colors all finsets** - ⚠️ (Same as 1170-1177)
   ```lean
   def PartitionRelation (α : Type*) (r : ℕ) (γ : Type*) (targets : γ → Type*) : Prop :=
     ∀ (coloring : Finset α → γ), ...
   ```

   This assigns a color to every finset, not just r-element subsets. While equivalent in practice
   (the conclusion only checks r-element sets), the standard definition would be:
   ```lean
   ∀ (coloring : {s : Finset α // s.card = r} → γ), ...
   ```

2. **Could add note about cardinality** - ⚠️
   The docstring mentions "let kappa be an infinite type" but could clarify that in set theory,
   this would specify cardinality constraints (e.g., κ is an infinite cardinal).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ **Correct statement format** - This is an implication ("Does X imply Y?"), stated as `X → Y`, which is the right approach
- ✅ Defines PartitionRelation clearly with good documentation
- ✅ Uses `Sum (kappa_targets α) Unit` to encode κ_α + 1
- ✅ Proper category: `research open`
- ✅ AMS 03 (Set theory) is appropriate
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Good docstring explaining the implication
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Consider whether the PartitionRelation definition should be moved to a shared file if it's reused across multiple problems (1167, 1170, 1171, 1172).

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - This is one of the better formalizations. The statement format is appropriate for an implication, the mathematical structure is clear, and the encoding of κ_α + 1 using Sum is reasonable.
