# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1122

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1122.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of an open question about additive functions and monotonicity. Correctly uses answer elaborator for a yes/no question.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1122)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct - asks "must f(n) = c*log(n)?")
- ✅ Proper formalization of multiplicatively additive functions
- ✅ Clean use of Filter.Tendsto and o-notation
- ✅ Good mathematical structure

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization of a number theory question.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of questions about arithmetic functions with asymptotic conditions.
