# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1122

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1122.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Likely wrong statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem formalization where the statement appears incorrect (the property it asserts is false for general additive functions).

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Likely incorrect statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem additive_function_monotonicity :
       ∀ (f : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ m n, f (m + n) = f m + f n) → ∃ (k : ℕ), ∀ n, f n ≤ k * n := by
   ```
   This asserts all additive functions ℕ → ℕ have linear upper bounds, which may not be true (e.g., constant functions work, but the problem likely asks about non-trivial additive functions or has additional hypotheses).

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what is being asked about additive functions.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Additive functions and monotonicity" without explaining the question.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

6. **Possible missing hypotheses** - ℹ️
   The problem likely has additional constraints (e.g., f is non-decreasing, or f(1) = 1, or similar).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1122)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Clean statement of additivity property
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Verify the statement and add any missing hypotheses (check the reference for the actual problem conditions).

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what is being asked.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the question about additive functions and their growth.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization likely has an incorrect or incomplete statement. Needs verification against the source and possible addition of hypotheses.
