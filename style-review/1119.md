# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1119

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1119.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized solved result about cardinality of families of entire functions. Properly uses statement form with set theory and cardinal arithmetic.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (SOLVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Hales 1974)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1119)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts universal property)
- ✅ Proper use of cardinal arithmetic
- ✅ Clean constraints on cardinal 𝔪
- ✅ Good formalization with explicit hypotheses

## Recommendations

None. Excellent formalization of a set-theoretic result.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper use of cardinal arithmetic and set theory in function spaces.
