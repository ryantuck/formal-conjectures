# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1119

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1119.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Trivial statement and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem marked SOLVED but the statement is trivially false or not meaningful (asserts all finite sets of functions have bounded cardinality by some n). The actual problem hasn't been captured.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Problematic statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem cardinality_entire_function_families :
       ∃ (n : ℕ), ∀ (S : Finset (ℂ → ℂ)), S.card ≤ n := by
   ```
   This asserts there exists a universal bound n for all finite sets of functions, which is false (finite sets can be arbitrarily large). The actual problem likely asks about families with specific properties.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (SOLVED).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what constraints on the family of entire functions make the cardinality bound meaningful.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Cardinality of families of entire functions" without explaining what properties the families must have.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

6. **Missing constraints** - ℹ️
   Should specify what properties the family must satisfy (e.g., pairwise having certain relationships, defined on certain domains, etc.).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1119)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category for solved problem
- ✅ Correct AMS 30 for analysis
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate statement to include proper constraints on the family of entire functions (e.g., satisfying certain orthogonality, growth conditions, or other properties).

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what properties the family must have.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what makes this a non-trivial cardinality bound.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization's statement doesn't capture the actual mathematical content. Needs reformulation with appropriate constraints on the family of functions.
