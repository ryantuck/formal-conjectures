# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1131

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1131.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in definition and missing STATUS

## Summary
Well-structured problem about integral minimization for Lagrange basis functions. Issues with sorry in definition and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in definition (Line 36)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def I {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry
   ```
   The key definition is completely unimplemented. While allowed, it makes the formalization incomplete.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Integral of squared Lagrange basis functions" without explaining the minimization question.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1131)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 41 (approximations)
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Clean lower bound statement with asymptotic term
- ✅ Existence of positive constant c
- ✅ Good use of Set.Icc for interval constraints
- ✅ Clear bound form: 2 - (1 + c)/n
- ✅ Definition has docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Implement or specify the I definition (integral of squared basis functions), or provide clearer mathematical specification.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what integral minimization question is being asked.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good mathematical formalization with clear open question. Main issue is the sorry in the definition. Only needs definition specification and STATUS line addition.
