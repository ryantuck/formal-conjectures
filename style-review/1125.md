# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1125

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1125.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Wrong statement structure and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem marked PROVED but the statement has incorrect hypothesis application (convexity applied to wrong thing) and trivial conclusion.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Incorrect statement** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem convexity_monotonicity :
       ∀ (f : ℝ → ℝ), Convex ℝ (Set.Ici (0 : ℝ)) → Monotone f → ∃ (x : ℝ), f x ≥ 0 := by
   ```
   Issues:
   - `Convex ℝ (Set.Ici (0 : ℝ))` is a statement about the set [0,∞), not about f (and [0,∞) is already convex)
   - Should be something like `ConvexOn ℝ (Set.Ici 0) f` if f is convex
   - The conclusion `∃ x, f x ≥ 0` is almost trivial for real functions

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what relationship between convexity and monotonicity is being proven.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Convexity and monotonicity" without explaining the result.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Topology is not obviously used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1125)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category for solved problem
- ✅ Correct AMS 26 for real functions
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Reformulate statement with correct convexity predicate (ConvexOn) and non-trivial conclusion about the relationship between convexity and monotonicity.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining the result being proven.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what is being proved about convex and monotone functions.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization has structural errors in how convexity is expressed. Needs reformulation to correctly capture the relationship between convexity and monotonicity.
