# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1125

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1125.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of a proved result about convexity and monotonicity. Properly uses statement form with historical attribution for two independent proofs.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (PROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with attribution (Kemperman measurable case, Laczkovich 1984 general case)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1125)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 26` for real functions)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts disjunction)
- ✅ Proper formalization of discrete convexity condition
- ✅ Clean use of Monotone and Antitone
- ✅ Good mathematical structure

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization of a real analysis result.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of convexity-related results with clean logical structure.
