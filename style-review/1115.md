# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1115

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1115.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Well-formalized disproved result about path growth in entire functions. Correctly uses statement form (not answer elaborator) since this is a constructive existence statement.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (DISPROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with historical attribution (Gol'dberg and Eremenko 1979)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1115)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Topology Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with excellent docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts existence constructively)
- ✅ Proper use of complex analysis concepts
- ✅ Clean use of Filter.atTop and asymptotics
- ✅ Good formalization of entire functions and path properties

## Recommendations

None. This is an excellent formalization of a disproved conjecture.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Demonstrates proper formalization of a disproved result with appropriate mathematical structure.
