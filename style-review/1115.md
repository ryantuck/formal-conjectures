# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1115

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1115.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Status/category mismatch and answer pattern issues

## Summary
Problem marked as DISPROVED but uses `research open` category and non-standard answer elaborator, creating critical inconsistencies.

**Score:** 13/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Status/category mismatch** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   - File docstring says "DISPROVED"
   - But uses `@[category research open, AMS 30]`
   - For a disproved problem, should use `research solved` and likely `answer(False)`

2. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 37)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem path_growth_entire_functions (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ sorry := by
   ```
   Uses `answer` as parameter. For a disproved problem, should be:
   ```lean
   theorem path_growth_entire_functions :
       answer(False) ↔ [statement of what was disproved] := by
   ```

3. **Sorry in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   The entire RHS is `sorry`, making the statement completely unspecified.

4. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what was disproved.

### Minor Issues

5. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Path growth in entire functions of finite order" without explaining what question was disproved.

6. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1115)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix status/category inconsistency - change to `research solved` if disproved.

**Priority 2:** Fix answer elaborator to use `answer(False)` on LHS for disproved statement.

**Priority 3:** Complete the statement by specifying what was disproved.

**Priority 4:** Add theorem docstring explaining what was disproved and ideally citing the counterexample.

**Priority 5:** Expand problem description to explain the original conjecture and its disproof.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization has severe inconsistencies between its claimed status (DISPROVED) and its actual structure (open with incomplete statement). Needs major revision to be coherent.
