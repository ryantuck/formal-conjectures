# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1104

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1104.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and wrong reference format

## Summary
Well-structured formalization with two related theorems (lower and upper bounds). Main issues are incorrect copyright year and non-standard reference URL format.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Wrong reference format (Line 21)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   *Reference:* https://www.erdosproblems.com/1104
   ```
   Should use markdown link format:
   ```lean
   *Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1104](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1104)
   ```

3. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line. Since theorems are marked `research solved`, it should say SOLVED.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent structure with paired lower/upper bound theorems
- ✅ Comprehensive theorem docstrings with mathematical notation and references to specific papers
- ✅ Good definition of `triangleFreeMaxChromatic` with clear docstring
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1104)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Both theorems marked `research solved` with AMS 5
- ✅ Clear attribution to specific results (Hefty-Horn-King-Pfender 2025, Davies-Illingworth 2022)
- ✅ Good use of filters (∀ᶠ, atTop)
- ✅ Proper real number conversions and bounds
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Fix reference format to use markdown link.

**Priority 3:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 4:** Consider adding brief problem description in file docstring.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Excellent mathematical formalization with clear paired results and good attribution. Only needs copyright year fix, reference format fix, and enhanced docstring.
