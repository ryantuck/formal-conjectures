# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1102

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1102.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and missing STATUS

## Summary
Excellent formalization with multiple related theorems and clear definitions of properties P and Q. Main issues are incorrect copyright year and missing problem STATUS.

**Score:** 19/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line. Since all theorems are marked `research solved`, it should say SOLVED.

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   The file docstring only has the reference, though the definition docstrings partially compensate.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Outstanding structure with multiple related theorems
- ✅ Excellent definition docstrings for properties P and Q with mathematical notation
- ✅ Comprehensive theorem docstrings explaining each result
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1102)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ All theorems marked `research solved` with AMS 11
- ✅ Multiple aspects of the problem formalized (density zero, existence, upper/lower bounds)
- ✅ Good use of filters (atTop, 𝓝, limsup, Tendsto)
- ✅ Clear mathematical statements with proper quantifiers
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Good use of range for sequences

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Add a brief description summarizing what properties P and Q are about.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - This is an exemplary formalization with excellent structure and clear documentation. Only needs copyright year fix and enhanced docstring. The mathematical content is comprehensive and well-organized.
