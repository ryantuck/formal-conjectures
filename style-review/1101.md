# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1101

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1101.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and missing STATUS

## Summary
Well-structured problem with multiple theorems and good definitions. Main issues are incorrect copyright year (2025 instead of 2026) and missing problem STATUS in docstring.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN/SOLVED/etc.).

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   The file docstring only has the reference, no description of what the problem asks.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent structure with multiple related theorems
- ✅ Comprehensive definitions with clear docstrings
- ✅ Good use of `IsGood` definition to organize properties
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1101)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Proper category and AMS attributes on all theorems
- ✅ Theorem docstrings present and clear
- ✅ Two variants of the problem properly distinguished
- ✅ Good use of asymptotic notation (=O, =o)
- ✅ Uses proper filter notation (∀ᶠ, atTop)
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating whether the problem is OPEN or partially SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Add a brief description to the file docstring explaining what the problem asks about.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Excellent formalization overall, but needs the copyright year fixed and docstring enhanced. The mathematical content is well-structured with clear definitions and multiple related results.
