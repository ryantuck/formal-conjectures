# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1174

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1174.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Question format issue

## Summary
Problem asks "Does there exist..." (twice) but uses statement format. Only formalizes question 1 of 2.

**Score:** 17/21 passing

## Issues

1. **Question format** - ❌ Docstring: "1. Does there exist..." → should use `answer(sorry) ↔`

2. **Incomplete** - ⚠️ Docstring lists 2 questions but only question 1 is formalized

3. **Vacuous condition** - Line 48:
   ```lean
   (∀ (coloring : Sym2 V → ℕ), True → ...)
   ```
   The `True →` is vacuous and should probably encode "with countably many colors"

## Current vs. Correct

**Current:**
```lean
theorem graph_coloring_monochromatic_cliques_question1 :
    ∃ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V), ... := by sorry
```

**Should be:**
```lean
theorem graph_coloring_monochromatic_cliques_question1 :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      (∃ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V), ...) := by sorry
```

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Uses SimpleGraph properly
- ✅ Good use of IsClique
- ✅ Mentions Shelah's consistency result
- ✅ Proper K₄ and K₃ formalization

## Recommendations
1. Fix question format with `answer(sorry) ↔`
2. Consider adding theorem for question 2
3. Replace `True →` with meaningful constraint about countability

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Question format required
