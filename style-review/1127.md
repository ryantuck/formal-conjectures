# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1127

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1127.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Non-standard answer pattern and missing STATUS

## Summary
Interesting formalization about decomposing Euclidean space with distinct distance constraints. Issues with answer elaborator pattern and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 17/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 37)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem euclidean_space_distinct_distance_decomposition (n : ℕ) (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∃ (partition : ℕ → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))), ...
   ```
   Uses `answer` as a parameter instead of `answer(sorry)` on the LHS for a SOLVED problem. Since this is marked solved, it should likely be:
   ```lean
   theorem euclidean_space_distinct_distance_decomposition (n : ℕ) :
       answer(True) ↔ ∃ (partition : ℕ → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))), ...
   ```
   Or possibly just state it directly without answer elaborator.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (SOLVED).

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Decomposition of ℝⁿ into sets with distinct pairwise distances" without mentioning SOLVED status.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1127)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Correct category `research solved` with AMS 52
- ✅ Problem marked as SOLVED in docstring
- ✅ Comprehensive statement with partition properties
- ✅ Clear use of Disjoint for partition condition
- ✅ Uses Set.univ for covering property
- ✅ Good quantifier structure for distinct distances
- ✅ Uses EuclideanSpace and dist correctly
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix answer elaborator pattern - use `answer(True)` on LHS for solved problem, or state directly without answer elaborator.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating SOLVED.

**Priority 3:** Consider whether this should use answer elaborator at all for a solved problem, or just state the result directly.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Excellent mathematical formalization with comprehensive statement. Only needs answer elaborator pattern fix and STATUS line addition.
