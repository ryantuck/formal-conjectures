# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1105

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1105.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Outstanding formalization with multiple related theorems about anti-Ramsey numbers for cycles and paths. Comprehensive references and clear mathematical statements.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent file docstring with multiple academic references
- ✅ Both theorems have clear docstrings with mathematical notation
- ✅ Reference URL included plus multiple paper citations
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1105)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Both theorems marked `research open` with AMS 05
- ✅ Two related problems properly distinguished (cycles vs paths)
- ✅ Good use of answer elaborator `answer(sorry)` for open questions
- ✅ Proper preconditions (k ≥ 3, k ≥ 5, k ≤ n)
- ✅ Clear use of let bindings for intermediate values
- ✅ Good use of asymptotic notation (=O)
- ✅ Proper conditional logic (if-then-else for parity)
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Minor Observations

1. **Complex formulas** - The statements are mathematically sophisticated with floor division and conditional terms, but this reflects the actual problem complexity.

2. **Implicit antiRamseyNum** - Assumes existence of `antiRamseyNum` function from imports, which is appropriate.

## Recommendations

No changes needed. This is an exemplary formalization.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is a model formalization with comprehensive references, clear mathematical statements, and proper handling of open questions with the answer elaborator. The file is complete and well-documented.
