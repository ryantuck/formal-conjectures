# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1139

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1139.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (minor: missing STATUS line and unusual spacing)

## Summary
Outstanding formalization about gaps in sequences with at most 2 prime factors. Clear use of answer elaborator and proper mathematical structure.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Minor Issues

1. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ℹ️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

2. **Unusual spacing (Line 17)** - ℹ️
   Missing blank line between copyright header and imports is non-standard but not critical.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear mathematical docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1139)
- ✅ Correct imports including ArithmeticFunction scoped notation
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 11
- ✅ Proper use of answer elaborator `answer(sorry)` for open question
- ✅ Clear definition using Nat.nth for the sequence
- ✅ Good predicate: 0 < n ∧ Ω n ≤ 2
- ✅ Uses limsup with EReal (extended reals) for infinity
- ✅ Proper use of filters (atTop)
- ✅ Good real number conversions
- ✅ Clean let binding for clarity
- ✅ Uses logarithm in gap ratio
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Optional:** Add blank line between copyright and imports for consistency.

**Optional:** Consider adding brief problem description, though the theorem docstring is very clear.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is an exemplary formalization with sophisticated use of extended reals and limsup to express that gaps grow faster than logarithmic. The use of Nat.nth to define the sequence and Ω for counting prime factors (with multiplicity) is proper. Only minor documentation enhancements possible.
