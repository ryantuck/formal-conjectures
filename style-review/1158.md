# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1158

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1158.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential

## Summary
Conjecture about Turán numbers for complete multipartite hypergraphs.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 44-48)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem turan_complete_multipartite_hypergraph_conjecture :
       ∀ (t r : ℕ), t > 0 → r > 0 →
       ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
       ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N,
         ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (ex n : ℝ) ≥ (n : ℝ)^(...) := by
   ```

   The `∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ)` is trivially satisfiable. For any bound, you can define ex to meet it.

   Should use `answer(sorry) ↔` for an open conjecture.

2. **No theorem docstring** - ❌
   Missing `/-- ... -/` above theorem (docstring is in middle).

### Minor Issues

3. **Not using question format** - ⚠️
   This is a conjecture, which is similar to a question about whether the bound holds.
   Could use `answer(sorry) ↔`.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent problem description with context
- ✅ Mentions Erdős's established bounds
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ AMS 05 (Combinatorics) is appropriate
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add `answer(sorry) ↔` since this is an open conjecture

**Priority 2:** Move existential outside or define ex properly

**Priority 3:** Move docstring above theorem

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivially true existential; needs answer elaborator.
