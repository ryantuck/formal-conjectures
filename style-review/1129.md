# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1129

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1129.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in definition and missing STATUS

## Summary
Well-structured problem about Lebesgue constants with good theorem statement. Issues with sorry in definition and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in definition (Line 36)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def Λ {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry
   ```
   The key definition is completely unimplemented. While this is allowed, it makes the formalization incomplete.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Minimizing the Lebesgue constant for Lagrange interpolation" without explaining the result.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1129)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Correct category `research solved` with AMS 41 (approximations)
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Clean existence statement for minimum
- ✅ Good use of Set.Icc for interval constraints
- ✅ Proper universal quantification over other point sets
- ✅ Definition has docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Implement or specify the Λ definition (Lebesgue constant), or at least provide a clearer mathematical specification in comments.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what the minimization result states.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good mathematical formalization with clear structure. Main issue is the sorry in the definition, which should ideally be implemented or at least more clearly specified. Only needs definition completion and STATUS line.
