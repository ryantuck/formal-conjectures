# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1113

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1113.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Sorry in type position and non-standard answer pattern

## Summary
Problem formalization with critical issues: uses non-standard answer elaborator pattern and has sorry in type position.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 37)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem sierpinski_without_covering (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∃ k : ℕ, Odd k ∧
         (∀ n : ℕ, ¬ Nat.Prime (k * 2^n + 1)) ∧
         sorry := by
   ```
   Uses `answer` as a parameter instead of `answer(sorry)` on the LHS.

2. **Sorry in type position (Line 40)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   The third conjunct is just `sorry`, making the statement incomplete.

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what the theorem asks about Sierpinski numbers.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Sierpinski numbers without finite covering sets" without explaining what this means.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1113)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Captures key Sierpinski property (k * 2^n + 1 is never prime)
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the answer elaborator pattern - use `answer(sorry)` on the LHS instead of `answer` as a parameter.

**Priority 2:** Complete the statement by replacing `sorry` with the property about not having a finite covering set.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what is being asked about Sierpinski numbers.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain what Sierpinski numbers and covering sets are.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization has both an incorrect answer elaborator pattern and an incomplete statement. Needs substantial fixes before it can be considered complete.
