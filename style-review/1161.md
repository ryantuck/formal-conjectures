# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1161

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1161.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential quantification

## Summary
Theorem about maximal order elements in symmetric groups. Uses existential quantification making it trivially true.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 47-52)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem maximal_order_elements_characterization :
       ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N,
         ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ) (k_min : ℕ → ℕ),
           (∀ k : ℕ, f k n ≤ (n - 1).factorial) ∧
           ...
   ```

   The `∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ)` is trivially satisfiable by taking f = λ _, λ _, 0.

   **Should define:** f_k(n) should be defined as the actual count of elements in S_n with order k, not existentially quantified.

2. **Status is SOLVED but uses answer elaborator pattern** - ⚠️
   For a solved problem, the statement should directly state the result, not use answer(sorry).
   However, since f_k(n) isn't properly defined, it's unclear how to state this correctly.

3. **Missing definition of f_k(n)** - ❌
   The docstring mentions "f_k(n) denote the count of elements..." but this is never defined formally.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good documentation with results by Beker
- ✅ Proper category: `research solved`
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Define f_k(n) properly, perhaps as:
```lean
def orderCount (k n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry  -- count of elements in S_n with order k
```

**Priority 2:** Rewrite theorem without existential quantification:
```lean
theorem maximal_order_elements_characterization :
    ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N,
      ∃ (k_min : ℕ),
        (orderCount k_min n = (n - 1).factorial) ∧
        (∀ k < k_min, orderCount k n < (n - 1).factorial)
```

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - The existential over f makes the statement trivially true. Need proper definition of f_k(n).
