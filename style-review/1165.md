# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1165

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1165.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Trivially true, no content

## Summary
Random walk favorite values problem. Statement is `(r = 3 → True) ∧ (r ≥ 4 → True)`, which is trivially true for all r ≥ 3.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true statement (Lines 47-50)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem favorite_set_cardinality_probability :
       ∀ (r : ℕ), r ≥ 3 →
         ((r = 3 → True) ∧ (r ≥ 4 → True)) := by
   ```

   This statement is completely vacuous. `X → True` is always true regardless of X.
   So this just says: ∀ r ≥ 3, (True ∧ True), which is trivially `True`.

   **Should state:** Something about the actual probabilities:
   - P(|F(n)| = 3 infinitely often) = 1
   - P(|F(n)| = r infinitely often) = 0 for r ≥ 4

2. **Missing probabilistic framework entirely** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   The problem is about probabilities, but there's no probability measure, no random walk, no events, nothing probabilistic in the formalization.

3. **Missing definition of F(n)** - ❌
   F(n) = set of most-visited positions is never defined.

4. **Missing definition of f_n(x)** - ❌
   Visit count function is never defined.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good documentation with results by Tóth and Hao et al.
- ✅ Proper category: `research solved`
- ✅ AMS 60 (Probability) is appropriate
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Replace the trivial statement with meaningful content. Options:
- Define the random walk, F(n), and state the probability results
- Or acknowledge in a comment that probability infrastructure is insufficient and leave as placeholder

**Priority 2:** If keeping a placeholder, make it less trivially true. At minimum use `answer(sorry)`:
```lean
theorem favorite_set_cardinality_probability :
    answer(True) ↔
      -- Placeholder: would state probability results here
      True := by
  sorry
```

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - The statement has zero mathematical content. Completely trivially true. This is one of the worst formalizations in terms of capturing the original problem's substance.
