# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1155

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1155.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential

## Summary
Theorem about random triangle deletion process with asymptotic bound n^{3/2+o(1)}.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 44-47)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem random_triangle_deletion_edges :
       ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
       ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
         (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) - ε) ≤ f n ∧ f n ≤ (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) + ε) := by
   ```

   The `∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ)` makes this trivially satisfiable. For any ε, take f(n) = ⌊n^{3/2}⌋.

   **Should use:** `answer(True) ↔` since the problem is partially solved, or define f from the random process.

2. **Missing probability aspect** - ❌
   The problem is about a random process but there's no probability in the statement.
   Docstring says "almost surely" but this isn't formalized.

3. **Status mismatch** - ⚠️
   File docstring says "PARTIALLY SOLVED" but uses `@[category research open]`
   Should probably be `@[category research solved]` given the 2015 result.

### Minor Issues

4. **Unused variable declarations (Line 35)** - ⚠️
   `variable {V : Type*} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]` declared but not used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Good documentation of the result by Bohman-Frieze-Lubetzky
- ✅ Proper asymptotic notation with epsilon-delta style
- ✅ Reference URL included

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add `answer(True) ↔` since problem is partially solved

**Priority 2:** Move existential outside with note about missing probability infrastructure

**Priority 3:** Update category to `research solved`

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivially true existential; needs answer elaborator and category update.
