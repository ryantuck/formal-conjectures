# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1160

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1160.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existential quantification

## Summary
Two theorems about group order conjectures. Both use existential quantification over the function g(n), making them trivially true.

**Score:** 17/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Trivially true due to existential (Lines 43-46)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem group_order_conjecture :
       ∀ (n m : ℕ), n ≤ 2^m →
       ∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ), g n ≤ g (2^m) := by
   ```
   The `∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ)` makes this trivially satisfiable. Just take g = λ _, 0.

   **Should be:** Either define g(n) as the number of groups of order n, or state as:
   ```lean
   theorem group_order_conjecture :
       answer(sorry) ↔
         (∀ (n m : ℕ), n ≤ 2^m →
           (GroupsOfOrder n).card ≤ (GroupsOfOrder (2^m)).card)
   ```

2. **Second theorem also trivially true (Lines 50-53)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem group_order_sum_conjecture :
       ∃ (M : ℕ), ∀ m ≥ M,
         ∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ), (Finset.range (2^m)).sum g ≤ g (2^m) := by
   ```
   Again, `∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ)` is trivially satisfiable.

3. **Not using question format** - ⚠️
   The docstring says "Conjecture: If n ≤ 2^m then..." but uses statement format.
   Should use `answer(sorry) ↔` since it's an open conjecture.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good documentation explaining both conjectures
- ✅ Proper category attributes
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Remove existential over g and either:
- Define g(n) as a specific function counting groups of order n
- Or use answer(sorry) with a proper formalization

**Priority 2:** Consider using question format for open conjectures

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - The mathematical content is lost due to existential quantification making both statements trivially true.
