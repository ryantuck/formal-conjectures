# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1157

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1157.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Trivial existentials

## Summary
Two theorems about Turán numbers for hypergraphs: a conjecture and a lower bound.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **First theorem trivially true (Lines 44-46)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem brown_erdos_sos_conjecture :
       ∀ (r t s k : ℕ), ... →
       ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (fun n => (ex n : ℝ)) =o[atTop] (fun n => (n : ℝ)^t) := by
   ```

   The `∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ)` makes this trivially satisfiable. Take ex = λ _, 0.

   Should use `answer(sorry) ↔` for an open conjecture.

2. **Second theorem also trivially true (Lines 53-56)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem turan_hypergraph_lower_bound :
       ∀ (r k s : ℕ), ... →
       ∃ (C : ℝ) (N : ℕ), C > 0 ∧ ∀ n ≥ N,
         ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), ... := by
   ```

   Again, `∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ)` is trivially satisfiable.

3. **No theorem docstrings** - ❌
   Missing `/-- ... -/` above theorems (docstrings are in middle).

### Minor Issues

4. **Unused variable** - ⚠️ (Line 35)
   `variable {α : Type*}` declared but never used.

5. **Status unclear** - ⚠️
   Both marked `@[category research open]` but the second is described as a "Known lower bound" suggesting it's proved.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Good documentation of conjecture and known results
- ✅ Uses little-o notation properly `=o[atTop]`
- ✅ Proper category attributes
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add `answer(sorry) ↔` to conjecture theorem

**Priority 2:** For the lower bound, either use `answer(True) ↔` if it's proved, or define ex properly

**Priority 3:** Move docstrings above theorems

**Priority 4:** Remove unused variable

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Both theorems are trivially true due to existential over ex.
