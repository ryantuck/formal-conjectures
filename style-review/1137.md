# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1137

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1137.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (minor: missing STATUS line)

## Summary
Outstanding formalization about prime gap products with clear use of answer elaborator for an open question.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Minor Issue

1. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ℹ️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear mathematical docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1137)
- ✅ Correct imports including Filter and Finset
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with AMS 11
- ✅ Proper use of answer elaborator `answer(sorry)` for open question
- ✅ Clear statement about ratio of gap products tending to 0
- ✅ Uses primeGap function for gaps between consecutive primes
- ✅ Proper use of Finset.range and sup
- ✅ Good real number conversions
- ✅ Uses Tendsto with neighborhood of 0
- ✅ Clean mathematical notation
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Optional:** Consider adding brief problem description, though the theorem docstring is very clear.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is an exemplary formalization with clear mathematical content about prime gaps. The use of the answer elaborator for an open question is proper, and the statement about the ratio tending to 0 is well-formulated. Only minor documentation enhancement possible.
