# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1169

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1169.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Multiple issues

## Summary
Ramsey theory for ordinals. Several critical issues: k < ω doesn't make sense in Lean, vacuous True condition, and unclear formulation.

**Score:** 13/21 passing

## Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **`k < ω` doesn't make sense in Lean (Line 47)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem ramsey_omega_one_squared :
       ∀ (k : ℕ), k < ω →
   ```

   - `k` is a natural number (ℕ)
   - `ω` is from `Ordinal` namespace
   - Can't compare ℕ and Ordinal with `<` without coercion
   - Since k : ℕ, we have k < ω always (all natural numbers are less than ω)
   - This constraint is either vacuous or a type error

   **Should be:** Remove `k < ω` since all k : ℕ satisfy this automatically.

2. **Vacuous `True →` condition (Line 52)** - ❌
   ```lean
   (∀ (H : Set α), True →
     ∃ (s : Finset α), s.card = 2 ∧ (↑s : Set α) ⊆ H ∧ coloring s ≠ 1 ∨
     ∃ (t : Finset α), t.card = 3) := by
   ```

   - `True →` is vacuous
   - The disjunction at the end is confusing - does `∃ (t : Finset α), t.card = 3` mean anything?
   - It asserts there exists a 3-element finset (always true if |α| ≥ 3)

3. **Unclear formulation** - ⚠️
   The problem asks whether ω₁² ↛ (ω₁², 3)², meaning:
   - There exists a 2-coloring of pairs from ω₁²
   - No color-0 monochromatic set of order type ω₁²
   - No color-1 monochromatic 3-element set

   The formalization's second conjunct doesn't clearly capture this.

4. **Unused parameter k** - ⚠️
   The problem says "for all finite k < ω" but k doesn't appear in the statement body.
   The original might be asking about a family of problems indexed by k.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Good docstring mentioning Hajnal's result under CH
- ✅ Proper category: `research open`
- ✅ AMS 03 (Set theory) is appropriate
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Remove or fix `k < ω`:
```lean
theorem ramsey_omega_one_squared :
    ∀ (α : Type*) [Infinite α],
      ∃ (coloring : Finset α → Fin 2), ...
```

**Priority 2:** Clarify the formulation of the partition relation failure. Should state:
- No monochromatic copy of ω₁² in color 0
- No 3-element monochromatic set in color 1

**Priority 3:** Either use k in the statement or remove it from the quantifier

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - The `k < ω` comparison is problematic, the vacuous True and unclear second conjunct need fixing, and overall the formalization doesn't clearly capture ω₁² ↛ (ω₁², 3)².
