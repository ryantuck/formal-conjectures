## Detailed Observations

1. **Missing English Version**: The theorem docstring should start with `English version:`.
2. **Question Format**: The problem is a "Yes/No" question on erdosproblems.com. It should follow the question format using `answer(True)`.
3. **Finite Group Assumption**: The theorem uses `[Fintype G]`, but the problem statement (B.H. Neumann) applies to groups in general (center has finite index iff non-commuting graph has bounded clique size). The current formalization only addresses the finite case, which might be a simplification but should be noted.

## Conclusion

**Status: FAIL**

The formalization fails style requirements regarding docstrings and question formatting.
