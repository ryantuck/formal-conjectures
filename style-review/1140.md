# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1140

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1140.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Incorrect answer elaborator for DISPROVED problem

## Summary
Well-structured formalization of a disproved problem, but uses `answer(sorry)` when it should use `answer(False)` since the problem has been solved and the answer is negative.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Priority Issues

1. **Incorrect answer elaborator (Line 51)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem erdos_1140 :
       answer(sorry) ↔ {n : ℕ | satisfiesCondition n}.Finite := by
   ```

   The file docstring states "DISPROVED" and explains that the answer is No (finitely many). Should be:
   ```lean
   theorem erdos_1140 :
       answer(False) ↔ {n : ℕ | satisfiesCondition n}.Infinite := by
   ```
   OR if keeping Finite on RHS:
   ```lean
   theorem erdos_1140 :
       answer(True) ↔ {n : ℕ | satisfiesCondition n}.Finite := by
   ```

2. **Category should match status** - ⚠️
   File says "DISPROVED" but uses `category research solved`. This is technically correct (solved = answered), but the answer elaborator should reflect the actual answer.

### Minor Issues

3. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 40: `open scoped Topology Real` - doesn't appear to be used in the file.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Comprehensive file docstring with detailed explanation
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1140)
- ✅ Well-defined bespoke definition (`satisfiesCondition`)
- ✅ Good API support with `known_solutions` theorem
- ✅ Theorem docstrings present
- ✅ Proper category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Clear mathematical content

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the answer elaborator to reflect the actual answer (False for infinite, or True for finite)

**Priority 2:** Decide on phrasing: either ask "Are there infinitely many?" (answer False) or "Are there finitely many?" (answer True)

**Priority 3:** Remove unused `open scoped Topology Real` if not needed

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - The formalization is otherwise excellent but has a semantic error: it asks a question whose answer is known but uses `answer(sorry)` instead of the concrete answer.
