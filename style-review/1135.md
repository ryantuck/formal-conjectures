# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1135

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1135.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Outstanding formalization of the Collatz conjecture by reference to an external comprehensive formalization. Excellent documentation with multiple academic references.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent file docstring with comprehensive references
- ✅ Multiple academic citations included
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1135)
- ✅ Imports from dedicated Collatz module
- ✅ Correct category `research open` with dual AMS codes (11 and 37)
- ✅ Clear theorem docstring explaining the Collatz conjecture
- ✅ Uses `type_of%` to reference external formalization
- ✅ Avoids code duplication by referencing existing work
- ✅ Proper module organization
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Good practice: reuses existing formalization rather than duplicating

## Minor Observations

1. **No STATUS line** - The file could include "OPEN" in the module docstring, though the category attribute makes this clear.

2. **External dependency** - The formalization depends on `FormalConjectures.Wikipedia.CollatzConjecture`, which is good for reuse but means this review doesn't cover that module.

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Add explicit "OPEN" status line to module docstring for consistency.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is an exemplary formalization that properly reuses existing work, has comprehensive references, and follows best practices for avoiding duplication. The use of `type_of%` to reference an external formalization is elegant.
