# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1120

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1120.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - Sorry in type position and missing STATUS

## Summary
Problem formalization with incomplete statement containing sorry in type position, though the structure suggests partial progress.

**Score:** 15/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 38)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem path_length_polynomial_level_set (P : Polynomial ℂ) :
       ∃ (L : ℝ), 0 ≤ L ∧ L ≤ sorry := by
   ```
   The upper bound is incomplete (`sorry`), making the statement partial.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

3. **Missing theorem docstring** - ⚠️
   No docstring explaining what path length or level set is being discussed.

### Minor Issues

4. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Path length in polynomial level set" without explaining the question.

5. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Real is not obviously used.

6. **Incomplete formalization** - ℹ️
   The statement only asserts existence of some bound, but doesn't specify what the bound should be in terms of the polynomial or which level set.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1120)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Uses Polynomial ℂ correctly

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Complete the upper bound specification, replacing `sorry` with the actual expression.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring explaining what path length is being measured and which level set is being considered.

**Priority 4:** Expand problem description to explain the geometric/analytic question about paths in level sets.

**Priority 5:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

**Priority 6:** Consider adding definitions for "path length in level set" concepts.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - The formalization has the right structure but is incomplete. The upper bound expression needs to be specified to make this a complete problem statement.
