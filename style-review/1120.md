# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1120

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1120.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** - Complex formalization with potential issue

## Summary
Formalization of Erdős's conjecture about path lengths in polynomial level sets. The answer elaborator usage appears correct for the question form, but the formalization has an unusual structure using infimum that evaluates to 0.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Unusual formalization structure (Line 40-50)** - ℹ️
   The statement asks if a certain limit tends to infinity, but the inner expression is an infimum over paths that returns 0 (the type annotation suggests this). This seems to contradict the conjecture that path lengths should tend to infinity. The formalization may need review for correctness.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1120)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with good docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 30`)
- ✅ Question form with `answer(sorry)` (correct for existence question)
- ✅ Proper use of Polynomial API
- ✅ Clean use of continuous functions with Set.Icc

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Review the mathematical formalization to ensure it correctly captures the conjecture. The current formalization may need adjustment to properly express "shortest path length" rather than an infimum that appears to be 0.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** - The style is perfect, but the mathematical formalization requires review for correctness.
