# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1142

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1142.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Missing theorem docstring, brief description

## Summary
Straightforward formalization with correct structure, but minimal documentation and unused imports.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   @[category research open, AMS 11]
   theorem primes_form_n_minus_power_of_two :
   ```
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment. Should explain what "primes of form n - 2^k" means and why this is interesting.

2. **Brief problem description (Line 22)** - ℹ️
   File docstring just says "Primes of the form n - 2^k."
   Could benefit from:
   - Why this form is interesting
   - Connection to other prime problems
   - Any conjectures or partial results

3. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

4. **Statement could be clearer** - ℹ️
   The condition `∃ n k : ℕ, p = n - 2^k` is very general (any prime works for some n, k). Perhaps the problem asks for specific constraints on n or k?

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1142)
- ✅ Proper imports structure
- ✅ Clear use of Set.Infinite
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11
- ✅ Statement form correctly used

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add theorem docstring with mathematical context

**Priority 2:** Expand problem description and clarify the constraints on n and k

**Priority 3:** Remove unused imports

**Priority 4:** Verify the mathematical content matches the original problem (the current formulation seems too general)

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Clean code structure, but may need verification of mathematical content and better documentation.
