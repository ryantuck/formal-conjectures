# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1151

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1151.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - Well-structured with definitions

## Summary
Theorem about Lagrange interpolation and limit points. Includes definitions of Chebyshev nodes and Lagrange interpolation operator.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **Not using question format** - ⚠️
   The problem appears to be asking whether every closed subset A ⊆ [-1,1] can arise as the set of limit points. This seems like a question, so could use `answer(sorry) ↔`.

2. **Missing documentation for definitions** - ⚠️
   `lagrangeInterp` is defined as `sorry` with no docstring explaining what it should compute.

3. **`variable {n : ℕ}` declared but not used** - ⚠️ (Line 35)
   The variable declaration is present but the variable isn't used in the scope.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Defines Chebyshev nodes explicitly
- ✅ Clear structure with auxiliary definitions
- ✅ Uses proper asymptotic/topology notation (`Tendsto`, `atTop`, `𝓝`)
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ File builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Consider adding `answer(sorry) ↔` if this is asking "Does there exist...?" or "For which sets A...?"

**Optional:** Add docstrings for `lagrangeInterp`

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - One of the better formalizations with actual definitions and clear structure.
