# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1170

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1170.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Reviewer:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Summary

Problem 1170 (partition consistency for ω₂) has a formalization issue: it asks a consistency question "Is it consistent that..." but uses statement format instead of question format with `answer(sorry)`.

**Overall Score:** 17/21 items passing

## Detailed Checklist

### ✅ File Structure & Organization (3/3)
- [x] **1. One problem per file** - ✅ PASS
- [x] **2. Correct directory structure** - ✅ PASS
- [x] **3. Copyright header** - ✅ PASS

### ⚠️ Problem Statement Format (2/3)
- [x] **4. Uses `theorem` keyword** - ✅ PASS
- [ ] **5. Question format** - ❌ **FAILURE**

  **Issue:** Docstring asks "Is it consistent (in ZFC) that ω₂ → (α)₂²..."

  This is a QUESTION ("Is it consistent...?"), so per style guidelines should use:
  ```lean
  theorem name : answer(sorry) ↔ P := by sorry
  ```

  **Current (incorrect):**
  ```lean
  theorem partition_omega_two_consistency :
      ∀ (alpha_type : Type*) (omega_two_type : Type*) [Infinite omega_two_type],
        PartitionRelation omega_two_type 2 (Fin 2) (fun _ => alpha_type) := by
    sorry
  ```

  **Should be:**
  ```lean
  theorem partition_omega_two_consistency :
      answer(sorry) ↔
        ∀ (alpha_type : Type*) (omega_two_type : Type*) [Infinite omega_two_type],
          PartitionRelation omega_two_type 2 (Fin 2) (fun _ => alpha_type) := by
    sorry
  ```

- [x] **6. Statement format** - N/A

### ✅ Attributes & Tags (3/3)
- [x] **7. `@[category]` attribute** - ✅ PASS - `research open`
- [x] **8. `@[AMS]` attribute** - ✅ PASS - `AMS 03` (Set theory)
- [x] **9. Both attributes combined** - ✅ PASS

### ✅ Documentation & References (4/4)
- [x] **10. File docstring** - ✅ PASS
- [x] **11. Reference URL** - ✅ PASS
- [x] **12. Problem description** - ✅ PASS - Good explanation of consistency question
- [x] **13. Theorem docstring** - ✅ PASS - Comprehensive with ZFC context

### ✅ Definitions & API (2/2)
- [x] **14. Bespoke definitions** - ✅ PASS - Defines PartitionRelation
- [x] **15. Basic API** - ✅ PASS (implicit - definition is self-contained)

### ✅ Code Quality (3/3)
- [x] **16. Code builds** - ✅ PASS (verified earlier)
- [x] **17. Import structure** - ✅ PASS
- [x] **18. Namespace usage** - ✅ PASS

### ⚠️ Answer Elaborator Usage (0/3)
- [ ] **19-21. Answer elaborator** - ❌ **NOT USED** when question format required

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Fix
Reformat as question since docstring asks "Is it consistent that...?"

### Optional Improvements
1. Consider simplifying PartitionRelation definition or moving to shared file
2. Add note about Laver and Foreman-Hajnal results in file docstring

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Should use question format with `answer(sorry)`
