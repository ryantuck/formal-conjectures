# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1150

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1150.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - `sorry` in type position

## Summary
Placeholder formalization with `sorry` appearing in the type position, making the statement unparseable.

**Score:** 12/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **`sorry` in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem ultraflat_polynomials :
       ∃ (P : ℕ → Polynomial ℂ), sorry := by
   ```

   The `sorry` appears where a `Prop` should be. This is a syntax error waiting to happen.
   Should be something like:
   ```lean
   theorem ultraflat_polynomials :
       answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ (P : ℕ → Polynomial ℂ), ... := by
   ```

2. **No theorem docstring** - ❌
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment above the theorem explaining what it's about.

3. **No problem description in file docstring** - ⚠️
   File docstring just says "Ultraflat polynomials with ±1 coefficients" but doesn't explain the problem.

4. **Minimal content** - ⚠️
   The formalization is essentially empty — just a type signature with `sorry`.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ AMS 26 (Real functions) is reasonable

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the `sorry` in type position. Either use `answer(sorry) ↔` format or replace `sorry` with an actual proposition about ultraflat polynomials.

**Priority 2:** Add substantial problem description — what makes a polynomial "ultraflat"? What coefficients? What property?

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Statement is essentially empty with `sorry` in type position. Needs complete rewrite.
