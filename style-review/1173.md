# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1173

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1173.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Question format issue

## Summary
Problem asks "Does there exist a free set...?" but uses statement format. Also has incomplete cardinality constraints.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

1. **Question format** - ❌ Docstring: "Question: Does there exist..." → should use `answer(sorry) ↔`

2. **Incomplete constraint** - ⚠️ Line 49:
   ```lean
   (∀ α β : omega_omega_plus_one, α ≠ β → True) →
   ```

   This should encode "|f(α) ∩ f(β)| < ℵ_ω" but just has `True`.

## Current vs. Correct

**Current:**
```lean
theorem free_set_under_gch :
    ∀ (omega_omega_plus_one : Type*) ...,
    ∀ (f : ...),
      (∀ α β, α ≠ β → True) →  -- Missing constraint!
      ∃ (S : Set ...), ... := by sorry
```

**Should be:**
```lean
theorem free_set_under_gch :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      (∀ (omega_omega_plus_one : Type*) ...,
       ∀ (f : ...),
         (∀ α β, α ≠ β → ...[bounded intersection]...) →
         ∃ (S : Set ...), ...) := by sorry
```

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Clear definition of "free set" in docstring
- ✅ Good explanation of GCH context
- ✅ Proper free set condition in theorem body

## Recommendation
1. Fix question format
2. Complete the bounded intersection constraint
