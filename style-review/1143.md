# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1143

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1143.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - `sorry` in type position

## Summary
Placeholder formalization with `sorry` in type position, making the statement incomplete and unparseable.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **`sorry` in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem prime_multiples_in_intervals :
       ∃ (F : ℕ → List ℕ → ℕ), sorry := by
   ```

   The `sorry` appears where a `Prop` should be. This makes the theorem statement meaningless.
   Should be something like:
   ```lean
   theorem prime_multiples_in_intervals :
       ∃ (F : ℕ → List ℕ → ℕ), ∀ k primes, F k primes = ... := by
   ```
   OR use answer elaborator if the answer is unknown:
   ```lean
   def F_k : ℕ → List ℕ → ℕ := answer(sorry)
   ```

2. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment explaining what F_k represents.

3. **Minimal problem description (Line 22)** - ⚠️
   "Estimation of F_k(p₁,...,p_u) for multiples of primes in intervals" doesn't explain:
   - What F_k computes
   - What the estimation problem is asking
   - What p₁,...,p_u represent

4. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1143)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** CRITICAL - Fix the `sorry` in type position. Either:
   - Complete the proposition about F
   - Define F separately and state properties
   - Use answer elaborator appropriately

**Priority 2:** Add substantial problem description explaining what the estimation problem asks

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - The theorem statement is essentially empty with `sorry` in type position. This needs complete rewrite to be meaningful.
