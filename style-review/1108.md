# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1108

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1108.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Wrong copyright year and missing STATUS

## Summary
Well-structured formalization with two related theorems and clear definitions. Issues with copyright year and missing problem STATUS.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Wrong copyright year (Line 2)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   Copyright 2025 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```
   Should be:
   ```lean
   Copyright 2026 The Formal Conjectures Authors.
   ```

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (OPEN).

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only has the reference, though the theorem docstrings partially compensate.

4. **Missing definition docstring for IsPowerful** - ℹ️
   Line 38: While there's an inline comment, a proper docstring would be better since this is a key concept.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent structure with two related theorems
- ✅ Good definition of `FactorialSums` with clear docstring using mathematical notation
- ✅ Clear theorem docstrings repeating the full problem statement
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1108)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements including BigOperators
- ✅ Both theorems marked `research open` with AMS 11
- ✅ Two aspects properly distinguished (k-th powers vs powerful numbers)
- ✅ Good use of answer elaborator `answer(sorry)` for open questions
- ✅ Uses Finset for finite sums with proper notation (∑)
- ✅ Set comprehension syntax is clear
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Update copyright year to 2026.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating OPEN.

**Priority 3:** Add brief problem description summarizing what's being asked about factorial sums.

**Priority 4:** Convert inline comment for `IsPowerful` to proper docstring.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good mathematical formalization with clear definitions and two related open questions. Only needs copyright fix and enhanced docstring.
