# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1110

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1110.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - Non-standard answer elaborator pattern

## Summary
Problem formalization with critical issue: uses non-standard answer elaborator pattern where `answer` is a parameter rather than using `answer(sorry)` on the RHS.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Non-standard answer elaborator (Line 37)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem coprime_power_representation (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ a b k : ℕ,
         Nat.Coprime a b ∧ n = a^k + b^k := by
   ```
   The answer elaborator should be `answer(sorry)` on the LHS of the biconditional, not `answer` as a parameter.

   Should be:
   ```lean
   theorem coprime_power_representation :
       answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ a b k : ℕ,
         Nat.Coprime a b ∧ n = a^k + b^k := by
   ```

2. **Missing theorem docstring** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   No docstring explaining what the theorem asks.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Representability using powers of coprime integers" without explaining the question.

4. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - neither appears to be used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1110)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes
- ✅ Problem marked as OPEN in docstring
- ✅ Clear mathematical statement using Nat.Coprime
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Fix the answer elaborator pattern - use `answer(sorry)` on the LHS instead of `answer` as a parameter.

**Priority 2:** Add theorem docstring explaining what question is being asked.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description in file docstring.

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** - The formalization uses an incorrect answer elaborator pattern. This needs to be fixed for consistency with repository standards.
