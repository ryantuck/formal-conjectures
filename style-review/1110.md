**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1110.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11

## Summary
Clear formalization of representability using powers of coprime integers. Uses custom definitions with good API support and statement form for the main result.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (OPEN)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1110)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Two bespoke definitions (`pqTerm` and `Representable`) with docstrings
- ✅ Main theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research open, AMS 11`)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - asserts infiniteness directly)
- ✅ Clean formalization with proper type constraints
- ✅ Good mathematical structure and naming

## Recommendations

None. The file demonstrates excellent practices for problems requiring custom definitions.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - A clean and well-structured formalization with appropriate custom definitions.
