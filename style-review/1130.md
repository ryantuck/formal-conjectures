# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1130

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1130.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in definition and missing STATUS

## Summary
Good formalization about Lebesgue constant bounds with clear structure. Issues with sorry in definition and missing STATUS.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in definition (Line 36)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   noncomputable def Λ {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry
   ```
   The key definition is completely unimplemented. While allowed, it makes the formalization incomplete.

2. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ⚠️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ℹ️
   File docstring only says "Lebesgue constants for Lagrange interpolation" without explaining the bound result.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1130)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Correct category `research solved` with AMS 41 (approximations)
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Clean lower bound statement
- ✅ Existence of constant c for the bound
- ✅ Good use of Set.Icc for interval constraints
- ✅ Proper use of logarithm and real arithmetic
- ✅ Definition has docstring
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Implement or specify the Λ definition (Lebesgue constant), or provide clearer mathematical specification.

**Priority 2:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what lower bound result is being stated.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Good mathematical formalization with clear bound statement. Main issue is the sorry in the definition. Only needs definition completion and STATUS line addition.
