# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1144

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1144.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **UNUSUAL PATTERN** - Non-standard answer elaborator usage

## Summary
Sophisticated formalization with probability theory and measure spaces, but uses unusual `(answer : Prop)` parameter pattern instead of standard answer elaborator.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Priority Issues

1. **Non-standard answer elaborator usage (Line 45)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   theorem random_multiplicative_function_sums (answer : Prop) :
       answer ↔ ∀ (Ω : Type*) ...
   ```

   This pattern with `(answer : Prop)` as a parameter is unusual. Standard patterns are either:
   - Question form: `theorem foo : answer(sorry) ↔ P := by sorry`
   - Statement form: `theorem foo : P := by sorry`

   The current form is valid but non-standard and may be confusing.

2. **Theorem docstring just repeats title (Line 43)** - ⚠️
   The docstring "Random completely multiplicative functions and partial sums" doesn't add information beyond the file title. Should explain:
   - What the theorem states about the partial sums
   - The probabilistic nature of the result
   - What the law of the iterated logarithm connection is

3. **Brief problem description (Line 22)** - ℹ️
   Could expand on the mathematical significance and context.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Excellent copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1144)
- ✅ Proper imports including MeasureTheory
- ✅ Well-defined bespoke definitions:
  - `IsCompletelyMultiplicative` with proper properties
  - `partialSum` with clear implementation
- ✅ Good API support with definitions
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11
- ✅ Sophisticated mathematical content with measure theory
- ✅ Proper use of probability measure and almost everywhere quantifier

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Consider changing to standard answer elaborator pattern:
   ```lean
   theorem random_multiplicative_function_sums :
       answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ (Ω : Type*) [MeasureSpace Ω] ...
   ```

**Priority 2:** Improve theorem docstring to explain the mathematical content, not just repeat the title

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description with more context about the probabilistic nature

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **UNUSUAL PATTERN** - The formalization is mathematically sophisticated with good definitions, but uses a non-standard pattern that may be confusing. Consider standardizing the answer elaborator usage.
