# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1145

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1145.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - `sorry` in type position

## Summary
Placeholder formalization with `sorry` in type position, making the statement incomplete.

**Score:** 14/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **`sorry` in type position (Line 38)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem sumset_convolution_growth :
       ∃ (A B : Set ℕ), sorry := by
   ```

   The `sorry` appears where a `Prop` about A and B should be. This makes the theorem meaningless.
   Should be something like:
   ```lean
   theorem sumset_convolution_growth :
       ∃ (A B : Set ℕ), (A + B contains something) ∧ (convolution property) := by
   ```

2. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment. Should explain what sumset containment and convolution growth mean.

3. **Minimal problem description (Line 22)** - ⚠️
   "Sumset containment and convolution growth" doesn't explain:
   - What sumset containment means
   - What convolution growth refers to
   - What the relationship between A and B is
   - What property is being conjectured

4. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1145)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** CRITICAL - Fix the `sorry` in type position by completing the proposition about A and B

**Priority 2:** Add substantial problem description explaining the sumset and convolution concepts

**Priority 3:** Add theorem docstring with clear mathematical explanation

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - The theorem statement is essentially empty with `sorry` in type position. Needs complete rewrite with actual mathematical content.
