# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1148

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1148.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Missing docstring, brief description

## Summary
Clean statement-form formalization with proper structure, but lacks theorem docstring and has minimal problem description.

**Score:** 18/21 passing

## Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **No theorem docstring (Line 36)** - ⚠️
   ```lean
   @[category research open, AMS 11]
   theorem sum_difference_squares :
   ```
   Missing `/-- ... -/` comment. Should explain what the theorem states about representing numbers.

2. **Brief problem description (Line 22)** - ℹ️
   "Representation as sum/difference of squares" is too brief. Could expand on:
   - Why this representation is interesting
   - Known partial results
   - Connection to other number theory problems
   - Whether this is a conjecture or open question

3. **Unused imports** - ℹ️
   Line 29: `open Finset Filter` - not used
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - not used

4. **Mathematical clarity** - ℹ️
   The statement `n = a^2 + b^2 ∨ (n : ℤ) = |(a : ℤ)^2 - (b : ℤ)^2|` is interesting but:
   - Should specify if a, b can be 0
   - The absolute value on the difference seems unusual for this type of problem
   - May want to verify this matches the original problem statement

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Correct directory and namespace (Erdos1148)
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Clear statement using universal quantification
- ✅ Correct category (research open) and AMS 11
- ✅ Statement form correctly used (not question form)
- ✅ No misuse of answer elaborator (statement form doesn't need it)
- ✅ Clean mathematical formulation with explicit types

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Add theorem docstring explaining the mathematical content and significance

**Priority 2:** Expand problem description with more context

**Priority 3:** Verify the mathematical content matches the original problem (especially the absolute value)

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Well-structured formalization with clear mathematical content, but would benefit from better documentation. The statement itself appears sound.
