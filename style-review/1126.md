# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1126

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1126.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (minor: missing STATUS line)

## Summary
Outstanding formalization of a measure-theoretic result about additive functions. Clean statement with proper use of almost-everywhere quantification.

**Score:** 20/21 passing

## Minor Issue

1. **Missing STATUS in file docstring** - ℹ️
   The file docstring should include a STATUS line (PROVED).

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Excellent theorem with clear docstring
- ✅ Proper use of measure theory (∀ᵐ for almost everywhere)
- ✅ Correct statement: functions satisfying Cauchy equation a.e. extend to everywhere
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper namespace (Erdos1126)
- ✅ Correct imports and open statements
- ✅ Correct category `research solved` with AMS 26
- ✅ Problem marked as PROVED in docstring
- ✅ Clean quantifier structure
- ✅ Proper use of filters for almost-everywhere statements
- ✅ Clear mathematical content about additive functions and measurability
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Optional:** Add STATUS line to file docstring indicating PROVED.

**Optional:** Consider adding a brief problem description, though the excellent theorem docstring compensates.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - This is an exemplary formalization with proper use of measure theory and clear mathematical content. Only minor documentation enhancement possible.
