# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1176

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1176.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Question format and vacuous `True`

## Summary
Problem asks "Is it true that...?" but uses statement format. Final quantifier is vacuous.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Issues

1. **Question format** - ❌ Docstring: "Is it true that there exists..." → should use `answer(sorry) ↔`

2. **Vacuous quantifier** - ⚠️ Line 50:
   ```lean
   ∃ (vertex_color : ℕ),
     ∀ (edge_color : ℕ), True := by sorry
   ```

   The `∀ (edge_color : ℕ), True` is vacuous. Should state relationship between colors.

## Current vs. Correct

**Current:**
```lean
theorem edge_vertex_coloring_property :
    ∀ (V : Type*) [Countable V] (G : SimpleGraph V),
      ∃ (edge_coloring : Sym2 V → ℕ),
        ... := by sorry
```

**Should be:**
```lean
theorem edge_vertex_coloring_property :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      (∀ (V : Type*) [Countable V] (G : SimpleGraph V),
        ...[with proper color relationship]...) := by sorry
```

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Uses Sym2 V for edges correctly
- ✅ Proper Countable constraint
- ✅ Mentions Hajnal-Komjáth consistency result
- ✅ Good problem description

## Recommendations
1. Fix question format
2. Replace vacuous `∀ (edge_color : ℕ), True` with actual containment condition
3. Encode "vertex color containing all edge colors" properly

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX** - Question format and complete formalization needed
