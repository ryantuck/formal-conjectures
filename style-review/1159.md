# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1159

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1159.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Completely vacuous statement

## Summary
Question about blocking sets in projective planes with uniform bound.

**Score:** 12/21 passing

## Critical Issues

1. **Completely vacuous statement (Lines 44-45)** - ❌ **CRITICAL**
   ```lean
   theorem blocking_sets_uniform_bound :
       (∃ (C : ℕ), C > 1 ∧ True) ∨ (∀ (C : ℕ), C > 1 → True) := by
   ```

   This statement is just `(∃ C > 1, True) ∨ (∀ C > 1, True)` which simplifies to `True ∨ True` = `True`.
   It has ZERO mathematical content.

   Missing: Any reference to projective planes, blocking sets, lines, or incidence.

2. **No theorem docstring** - ❌
   Missing `/-- ... -/` above theorem (docstring is in middle).

3. **Should use answer elaborator** - ❌
   The problem asks "Does there exist...?" so should use `answer(sorry) ↔`.

4. **No infrastructure** - ❌
   The problem requires definitions of projective planes, lines, blocking sets, and incidence relations, none of which are present even as `sorry` definitions.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Good problem description in docstring
- ✅ Mentions known weaker result by Erdős-Silverman-Stein
- ✅ Proper category attribute
- ✅ Reference URL included

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Replace the vacuous `True` statement with actual content. At minimum:
```lean
theorem blocking_sets_uniform_bound :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (C : ℕ), C > 1 ∧
        ∀ (P : ProjectivePlane), ∃ (S : BlockingSet P),
          ∀ (ℓ : Line P), 1 ≤ |S ∩ ℓ| ∧ |S ∩ ℓ| ≤ C := by
  sorry
```

**Priority 2:** Consider adding placeholder definitions for ProjectivePlane, BlockingSet, Line even if they're `sorry`.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL** - Statement is completely vacuous `True ∨ True`. Needs complete rewrite.
