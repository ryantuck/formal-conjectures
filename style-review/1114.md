# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1114

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1114.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - Sorry in type position and status mismatch

## Summary
Problem marked as PROVED but uses `research solved` category and has sorry in type position, creating inconsistencies.

**Score:** 16/21 passing

## Priority Issues

1. **Sorry in type position (Line 39)** - ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   ```lean
   theorem polynomial_derivative_zeros (P : Polynomial ℂ) :
       (∀ z : ℂ, P.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1) →
       ∀ z : ℂ, Polynomial.derivative P |>.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1 + sorry := by
   ```
   The bound constant is `sorry`, making the statement incomplete despite being marked PROVED. This should be a concrete constant.

2. **Status inconsistency** - ⚠️
   File says "PROVED" but has `research solved` category and incomplete statement. If proved, the constant should be concrete; if not fully formalized, status should be different.

### Minor Issues

3. **Brief problem description** - ⚠️
   File docstring only says "Polynomial roots and derivative zeros" without explaining the result.

4. **Unused import** - ℹ️
   Line 31: `open scoped Topology Real` - Real is not obviously used.

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Correct copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Proper file structure and namespace (Erdos1114)
- ✅ Reference URL included
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (AMS 30 for analysis)
- ✅ Clear theorem docstring
- ✅ Uses complex polynomial API correctly
- ✅ Uses norm (‖·‖) appropriately
- ✅ Builds successfully

## Recommendations

**Priority 1:** Replace `sorry` with the actual constant from the proof (likely related to the degree or some absolute constant).

**Priority 2:** Decide on correct status - if truly proved, complete the formalization; otherwise change to "SOLVED" or "OPEN".

**Priority 3:** Expand problem description to explain what bound is being established.

**Priority 4:** Remove unused imports or document why they're needed.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION** - The formalization has a status/completeness mismatch. A proved result should have a concrete bound, not sorry in the type. Either complete the formalization or adjust the status.
