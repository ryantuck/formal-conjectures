# Style Review: Erdős Problem 1114

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1114.lean`
**Review Date:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

## Summary
Clean formalization of a proved result about polynomial derivative zeros. Correctly uses statement form with `research solved` category.

**Score:** 21/21 passing

## Good Aspects
- ✅ Perfect copyright header (2026)
- ✅ Clear file docstring with STATUS line (PROVED)
- ✅ Reference URL included with historical attribution (Balint 1960)
- ✅ Proper imports and namespace (Erdos1114)
- ✅ Appropriate `open Finset` and `open scoped Real`
- ✅ Single theorem with comprehensive docstring
- ✅ Correct category and AMS attributes (`research solved, AMS 30` for analysis)
- ✅ Statement form (correct - no answer elaborator needed for proved result)
- ✅ Proper use of Polynomial API
- ✅ Clean formalization with explicit parameter typing using Fin
- ✅ Good mathematical structure

## Recommendations

None. This is an exemplary formalization of a solved problem.

## Conclusion
**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - A model formalization showing how to handle proved results with proper historical attribution.
