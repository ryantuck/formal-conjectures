# Erdős Problem 279 Formalization Log

## Problem Statement
For $k \geq 3$, can congruence classes $a_p \pmod{p}$ be chosen for every prime $p$ such that all sufficiently large integers can be written as $a_p + tp$ for some prime $p$ and integer $t \geq k$?

## Status
**OPEN** - Even the case $k=3$ appears difficult.
