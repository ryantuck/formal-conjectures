# Debugging Session Log - Erdos Problem 162

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Target File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/162.lean`

## Issue Description
The user reported that the build for `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/162.lean` was broken.

## Investigation
1.  **Initial Attempt:** Tried to build using `lake build FormalConjectures.ErdosProblems.162`, which failed with "no such file or directory" for the target module name.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Checked the content of `162.lean`.
    -   Found usage of `EdgeColoring` type which was not imported or defined in the file.
    -   Search revealed `EdgeColoring` was defined in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/136.lean` but not as a shared utility.
    -   The `induced_edges` definition used `Finset.univ : Finset G.edgeSet` which was causing type/logic issues with the coloring function application.

## Resolution
Modified `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/162.lean` to remove the dependency on the undefined `EdgeColoring` type and fix the edge set logic.

### Changes
-   **Type Replacement:** Replaced `EdgeColoring (completeGraph (Fin n)) (Fin 2)` with `Sym2 (Fin n) → Fin 2`.
-   **Logic Update:** Updated `induced_edges` to filter directly from `G.edgeFinset` and adjusted the predicate to work with `Sym2`.

### Code Diff

    let G := completeGraph (Fin n)
    let induced_edges := (Finset.univ : Finset G.edgeSet).filter (fun e => ∀ x ∈ e.1, x ∈ V')
    ∀ i : Fin 2, α * (V'.card.choose 2 : ℝ) < (induced_edges.filter (fun e => c e = i)).card
