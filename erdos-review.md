# Erdos Review

These instructions apply to formalizing conjectures of Erdos problems.

The majority of the problems have been formalized to some degree using AI tools.

All problems currently build successfully. The goal is to review them for completeness and provide details on what, if any, could be improved.

## Review conjecture formality

The model should review the implementation of the conjecture and critically compare its implementation to the definition of the problem listed at `https://www.erdosproblems.com/NUMBER`.

The model should aim to review the conjecture to determine whether its form adheres to the problem statement and identify parts of the conjecture that might benefit from further clarity or refinement.

The model should provide a confidence percentage from 0-100% that the conjecture as formalized sufficiently captures the problem.
