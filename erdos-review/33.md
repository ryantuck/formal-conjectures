# Erdős Problem 33 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set such that every integer can be written as $n^2 + a$ for some $a$ in $A$. What is the smallest possible value of $\limsup |A \cap \{1, \dots, N\}| / N^{1/2}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/33.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_33` asks for the value of this infimum over all valid bases $A$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof/value, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
