# Review: Erdos Problem 1128

**Problem:** Ramsey-type property for 2-coloring of A x B x C with |A| = |B| = |C| = aleph_1
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1128](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1128)
**Status:** DISPROVED

## Source Problem

Let A, B, C be three sets of cardinality aleph_1. Is it true that, in any 2-coloring of A x B x C, there must exist A_1 subset A, B_1 subset B, C_1 subset C, all of cardinality aleph_0, such that A_1 x B_1 x C_1 is monochromatic?

Disproved by Prikry and Mills (1978, unpublished), reported by Todorcevic and Komjath.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 03]
theorem ramsey_aleph_one :
    answer(False) ↔ (∃ S : Set (Set ℕ), True ∧ -- S has cardinality ℵ₁ (placeholder)
      True) := by -- Some Ramsey property that doesn't hold
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Entire statement is vacuous (CRITICAL)

The right-hand side of the iff is `∃ S : Set (Set N), True ∧ True`, which is trivially true (take S = empty set). Combined with `answer(False)`, the statement becomes `False ↔ True`, which is unprovable. This is incoherent.

### 2. Missing sets A, B, C of cardinality aleph_1 (CRITICAL)

The source involves three sets of cardinality aleph_1. The formalization uses a single set of sets of naturals with no cardinality constraint.

### 3. Missing 2-coloring (CRITICAL)

The source is about 2-colorings of the product A x B x C. No coloring function appears in the formalization.

### 4. Missing monochromatic subproduct condition (CRITICAL)

The key Ramsey property -- existence of countably infinite subsets whose product is monochromatic -- is entirely absent.

### 5. Wrong answer elaborator usage (CRITICAL)

The `answer(False)` is correctly oriented (the answer to the question "is it true?" is "no"), but since the RHS is trivially true, the biconditional `False ↔ True` can never be proved. The answer(False) should be on the left of a biconditional whose right side states the Ramsey property that was conjectured but is actually false.

### 6. Encoding aleph_1 in Lean (NOTE)

Properly encoding this problem requires types of cardinality aleph_1, which needs Cardinal and ordinal machinery from Mathlib. This is non-trivial but possible.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 03]
theorem ramsey_aleph_one :
    answer(False) ↔
      (∀ (α β γ : Type*) (_ : #α = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (_ : #β = Cardinal.aleph 1) (_ : #γ = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (c : α × β × γ → Fin 2),
        ∃ (A₁ : Set α) (B₁ : Set β) (C₁ : Set γ),
          #A₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          #B₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          #C₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          ∃ color : Fin 2, ∀ a ∈ A₁, ∀ b ∈ B₁, ∀ c' ∈ C₁,
            c (a, b, c') = color) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

The formalization captures only that the answer is False (which matches "disproved"). However, the mathematical content is entirely absent: no sets of cardinality aleph_1, no 2-coloring, no product structure, no monochromatic subproduct condition. The RHS is trivially true, making the biconditional unprovable.
