# Review: Erdos Problem 1128

**Problem:** Ramsey-type property for 2-coloring of A x B x C with |A| = |B| = |C| = aleph_1
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1128](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1128)
**Status:** DISPROVED

## Source Problem

Let A, B, C be three sets of cardinality aleph_1. Is it true that, in any 2-coloring of A x B x C, there must exist A_1 subset A, B_1 subset B, C_1 subset C, all of cardinality aleph_0, such that A_1 x B_1 x C_1 is monochromatic?

Disproved by Prikry and Mills (1978, unpublished), reported by Todorcevic and Komjath.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 03]
theorem ramsey_aleph_one :
    answer(False) ↔
      (∀ (α β γ : Type*) (_ : Cardinal.mk α = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (_ : Cardinal.mk β = Cardinal.aleph 1) (_ : Cardinal.mk γ = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (c : α × β × γ → Fin 2),
        ∃ (A₁ : Set α) (B₁ : Set β) (C₁ : Set γ),
          Cardinal.mk A₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          Cardinal.mk B₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          Cardinal.mk C₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          ∃ color : Fin 2, ∀ a ∈ A₁, ∀ b ∈ B₁, ∀ c' ∈ C₁,
            c (a, b, c') = color) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Overall structure is correct (POSITIVE)

The rewrite correctly captures the full structure of the source problem:
- Universal quantification over three types alpha, beta, gamma of cardinality aleph_1
- Universal quantification over all 2-colorings (c : alpha x beta x gamma -> Fin 2)
- Existential quantification over countably infinite subsets A_1, B_1, C_1
- The monochromatic condition on the sub-product

### 2. answer(False) correctly used (POSITIVE)

Since the problem was disproved, `answer(False)` is correct: the answer to "Is it true that..." is "No". The RHS states the Ramsey property, so `False <-> [Ramsey property]` asserts the Ramsey property is false, which matches the disproof.

### 3. Cardinal.mk vs # notation (MINOR)

The formalization uses `Cardinal.mk alpha = Cardinal.aleph 1` rather than the notation `#alpha = Cardinal.aleph 1`. Both are semantically equivalent; `#` is just notation for `Cardinal.mk`. This is purely cosmetic.

### 4. Subset constraint is implicit (MINOR)

The source specifies A_1 subset A, B_1 subset B, C_1 subset C. In the formalization, A_1 is `Set alpha`, B_1 is `Set beta`, C_1 is `Set gamma` -- since the types alpha, beta, gamma play the role of A, B, C respectively, any `Set alpha` is automatically a subset of the full type. This is correct: by universally quantifying over types of the right cardinality, the subset relationships are built in.

### 5. Consecutiveness of primes not relevant (NOTE)

The source says "sets of cardinality aleph_1" without further structure. The formalization correctly imposes no additional structure on the types.

### 6. Potential concern: universe levels (MINOR)

The use of `Type*` means the types could live in arbitrary universes. The statement `Cardinal.mk alpha = Cardinal.aleph 1` should work correctly regardless of universe level, since `Cardinal.aleph 1` is defined in a universe-polymorphic way in Mathlib. This should not be an issue.

### 7. Product associativity (MINOR)

The formalization uses `alpha x beta x gamma` which in Lean is `alpha x (beta x gamma)` (right-associated). The coloring function `c : alpha x beta x gamma -> Fin 2` then takes `(a, (b, c'))` as input, and the monochromatic condition uses `c (a, b, c')` which is sugar for `c (a, (b, c'))`. This correctly captures the 3-dimensional coloring.

## What a proper formalization would look like

The current formalization is already essentially correct. No structural changes are needed. A minor stylistic improvement would be to use `#` notation:

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 03]
theorem ramsey_aleph_one :
    answer(False) ↔
      (∀ (α β γ : Type*) (_ : #α = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (_ : #β = Cardinal.aleph 1) (_ : #γ = Cardinal.aleph 1)
        (c : α × β × γ → Fin 2),
        ∃ (A₁ : Set α) (B₁ : Set β) (C₁ : Set γ),
          #↥A₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          #↥B₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          #↥C₁ = Cardinal.aleph 0 ∧
          ∃ color : Fin 2, ∀ a ∈ A₁, ∀ b ∈ B₁, ∀ c' ∈ C₁,
            c (a, b, c') = color) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **92%**

The formalization is a faithful and complete capture of the source problem. The quantifier structure (for all types of cardinality aleph_1, for all 2-colorings, there exist countably infinite subsets with monochromatic product) exactly matches the source. The `answer(False)` correctly reflects the disproved status. The only minor concerns are cosmetic (notation choice) and a small theoretical question about whether `Cardinal.mk (Set.Elem A_1)` vs `Cardinal.mk A_1` behaves as expected for subtype cardinality, but in Mathlib `Cardinal.mk S` for `S : Set alpha` computes the cardinality of the subtype `{x : alpha // x in S}`, which is exactly the cardinality of the set. This is correct.
