# Review: Erdos Problem 1111

**Problem:** Chromatic number and anticomplete vertex sets
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1111](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1111)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

If G is a finite graph and A, B are disjoint vertex sets with no edges between them (anticomplete), then for any t, c >= 1, there exists d >= 1 such that: whenever chi(G) >= d and omega(G) < t (where chi is chromatic number and omega is clique number), there exist anticomplete sets A, B with chi(G[A]) >= chi(G[B]) >= c, where G[A] and G[B] are the induced subgraphs.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem chromatic_anticomplete {n : ℕ} (k : ℕ) :
    ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
      G.chromaticNumber ≥ k →
      ∃ (S : Finset (Fin n)), S.card ≥ f n ∧
        (∀ u ∈ S, ∀ v ∈ S, u ≠ v → ¬G.Adj u v) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Missing clique number bound (CRITICAL)

The source problem requires omega(G) < t as a hypothesis. Without bounding the clique number, high chromatic number alone does not force the structure described. The formalization has no clique number constraint at all.

### 2. Only one independent set instead of two anticomplete sets (CRITICAL)

The source asks for two disjoint sets A and B that are anticomplete to each other (no edges between A and B), each with high chromatic number on the induced subgraph. The formalization only finds a single independent set S (where no two vertices in S are adjacent). An independent set is a much weaker object than a pair of anticomplete sets with high chromatic number.

### 3. Measures size instead of chromatic number (CRITICAL)

The source requires chi(G[A]) >= c and chi(G[B]) >= c, meaning the induced subgraphs on A and B must have high chromatic number. The formalization only requires S.card >= f(n), measuring the size (cardinality) of an independent set. Cardinality of an independent set and chromatic number of an induced subgraph are very different things.

### 4. Wrong quantifier structure (CRITICAL)

The source problem says: for all t, c >= 1, there exists d >= 1 such that for all graphs G with chi(G) >= d and omega(G) < t, the conclusion holds. The formalization fixes n (the number of vertices), takes k (playing the role of d perhaps), and produces a function f: N -> N. The parameterization by t and c is completely lost.

### 5. Vertex set is fixed-size Fin n (MODERATE)

By using `SimpleGraph (Fin n)`, the graph has exactly n vertices. This is not necessarily wrong for finite graphs, but the implicit universal quantification over n via `{n : N}` combined with the structure of the statement does not correctly capture the original problem's quantifier nesting.

### 6. The conclusion is trivially satisfiable in many cases (MODERATE)

For any graph on n vertices, one can always find an independent set. In fact, Ramsey theory guarantees large independent sets or cliques. The statement as written (find an independent set of size f(n) given high chromatic number) is a known and much simpler result than the actual problem.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- For any t, c >= 1, there exists d such that any graph with
    chi(G) >= d and omega(G) < t contains anticomplete sets A, B
    with chi(G[A]) >= c and chi(G[B]) >= c -/
theorem chromatic_anticomplete :
    ∀ (t c : ℕ), 1 ≤ t → 1 ≤ c →
      ∃ (d : ℕ), ∀ (V : Type*) [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]
        (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
          G.chromaticNumber ≥ d →
          G.cliqueNum < t →
          ∃ (A B : Finset V), Disjoint A B ∧
            (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ B, ¬G.Adj a b) ∧
            (G.induce (↑A)).chromaticNumber ≥ c ∧
            (G.induce (↑B)).chromaticNumber ≥ c := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **3%**

The formalization captures the vague theme (chromatic number and independent/anticomplete structures) but gets nearly every detail wrong: missing clique number bound, wrong conclusion (independent set size vs. chromatic number of induced subgraphs), single set instead of pair, and wrong quantifier structure.
