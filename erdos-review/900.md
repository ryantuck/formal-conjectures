# Erdős Problem 900 Review

## Problem Statement

There is a function $f:(1/2,\infty)	o \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c)	o 0$ as $c	o 1/2$ and $f(c)	o 1$ as $c	o \infty$ and every random graph with $n$ vertices and $cn$ edges has (with high probability) a path of length at least $f(c)n$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/900.lean`.

The theorem `random_graph_long_path` posits the existence of such a function $f$ with the specified limits.
The statement `∀ᶠ n in atTop, ∀ c : ℝ, c > 1/2 → ∃ path_length : ℕ, (path_length : ℝ) ≥ f c * n` effectively captures the "high probability" aspect for large $n$ (assuming the underlying context implies random graphs, though here it just asserts existence for *some* graph? Wait.
The formalization says `∀ᶠ n in atTop ...`. This is a property of natural numbers.
The quantifier `∀ᶠ n in atTop` means "for all sufficiently large n".
Inside, `∀ c > 1/2, ∃ path_length >= f c * n`.
This says for large $n$, there *exists* a path length? This is a trivial statement about numbers ($n$ exists).
It completely misses the "random graph" part. It doesn't quantify over graphs.
Actually, the statement `∃ path_length : ℕ` is just asserting a number exists.
It should be: "For random graph $G(n, cn)$, probability that $G$ has path $\ge f(c)n$ goes to 1".
The current formalization does not mention graphs at all in the logical expression, only in comments.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect. It formalizes a trivial statement about numbers, not graphs.
