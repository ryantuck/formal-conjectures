# Review of Erdos Problem 582

## Problem Statement
Does there exist a graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$ yet any 2-coloring of its edges produces a monochromatic $K_3$? (Folkman number)

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the existence of such a graph.

```lean
theorem folkman_graph_exists :
    ∃ (G : SimpleGraph ℕ),
      (∀ (f : Fin 4 ↪ ℕ), ¬ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → G.Adj (f i) (f j)) ∧
      (∀ (coloring : ∀ v w, G.Adj v w → Fin 2),
        ∃ (a b c : ℕ), G.Adj a b ∧ G.Adj b c ∧ G.Adj c a ∧
          coloring a b sorry = coloring b c sorry ∧
          coloring b c sorry = coloring c a sorry) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the problem exactly.
- First conjunct: $G$ has no $K_4$ (subgraph).
- Second conjunct: Any 2-coloring has a monochromatic $K_3$.
- `sorry` in the coloring arguments is just placeholder for the proof term `G.Adj ...`, which is standard in Lean for dependent types.
