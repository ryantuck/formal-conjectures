# Review of Erdos Problem 609

## Problem Statement
Let $f(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that if edges of $K_{2^n+1}$ are $n$-colored, there must be a monochromatic odd cycle of length at most $m$. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines $f(n)$ differently.

```lean
/-- f(n): min length of longest monochromatic odd cycle in n-edge-colorings of K_{2^n+1} -/
noncomputable def f (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
```

## Critique
There is a semantic mismatch.
- **Problem:** $f(n) = \max_{\text{colorings}} (\min_{C \in \text{odd}} |C|)$. We want to find a bound $m$ such that we can *always* find an odd cycle of length $\le m$.
- **Formalization:** "min length of longest monochromatic odd cycle". This sounds like $\min_{\text{colorings}} (\max_{C \in \text{odd}} |C|)$.
- The bounds given in the problem "bounds: $2^{c\sqrt{\log n}}$ to ..." usually refer to the "minimal maximal" or "maximal minimal"?
- Actually, looking at the bounds: $2^{\dots}$ is small compared to $2^n$.
- If we wanted "longest", the longest odd cycle in $K_{2^n}$ is huge.
- So we are definitely looking for *short* odd cycles (girth).
- The formalization comment says "longest". This is likely a typo or misunderstanding. It should be "maximal length of the shortest odd cycle guaranteed".
- Or rather "minimal m such that we guarantee an odd cycle of length $\le m$". This is the "odd girth Ramsey number".

## Confidence
50% (Likely definition mismatch)
