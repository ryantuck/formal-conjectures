# Erdős Problem 1077 Review

## Problem Statement

We call a graph $D$-balanced if the maximum degree is at most $D$ times the minimum degree.
If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n^{1+\alpha}$ edges, then must $G$ contain a $D$-balanced subgraph on $m > n^{1-\alpha}$ vertices with at least $\epsilon m^{1+\alpha}$ edges?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1077.lean`.

The formalization relies on a definition `IsBalanced` which is not present in the file. Assuming `IsBalanced H.coe D` correctly implements the max degree $\le D 	imes$ min degree condition, the rest of the statement is accurately transcribed. The quantifiers and bounds on $m$ and edges match the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization appears correct, contingent on the external definition of `IsBalanced`.
