# Erdős Problem 44 Review

## Problem Statement

Can any Sidon set be extended to achieve a density arbitrarily close to optimal?

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/44.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_44` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this extendability. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
