# Erdős Problem 980 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that $\sum_{p<x} n_k(p)\sim c_k \frac{x}{\log x}$ where $n_k(p)$ is the least $k$th power nonresidue?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/980.lean`.

The function `n_k` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
