# Erdős Problem 967 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $1<a_1<\cdots$ be a sequence of integers such that $\sum\frac{1}{a_i}<\infty$. Is it true that, for every $t\in \mathbb{R}$, $1+\sum_{k}\frac{1}{a_k^{1+it}}
eq 0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/967.lean`.

The theorem `not_series_nonvanishing` correctly asserts the negation of the conjecture (since it's solved/disproved). It checks the condition for all $t$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
