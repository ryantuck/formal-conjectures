# Erdős Problem 8 Review

## Problem Statement

For any finite colouring of the integers, is there a covering system all of whose moduli are monochromatic?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/8.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_8` asks if `answer(False)` is equivalent to: for any finite coloring $f$, there exists a covering system where all moduli map to the same color. This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
