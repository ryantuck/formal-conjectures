# Erdős Problem 931 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k_1\geq k_2\geq 3$. Are there only finitely many $n_2\geq n_1+k_1$ such that $\prod_{1\leq i\leq k_1}(n_1+i)$ and $\prod_{1\leq j\leq k_2}(n_2+j)$ have the same prime factors?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/931.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_931` correctly asks if the set of pairs $(n_1, n_2)$ satisfying the condition is finite.
The condition `(∏ ...).primeFactors = (∏ ...).primeFactors` correctly captures "have the same prime factors".

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
