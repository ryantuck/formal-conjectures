# Erdős Problem 66 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an $A$ such that $\lim \frac{1_A * 1_A(n)}{\log n}$ exists and is non-zero?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/66.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_66` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a limit. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
