# Erdős Problem 226 Review

Entire function mapping rationals to rationals (and irrationals to irrationals?).

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/226.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_226` asserts existence of such a function (Barth-Schneider). Matches.

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
