# Erdős Problem 935 Review

## Problem Statement

For any integer $n=\prod p^{k_p}$ let $Q_2(n)$ be the powerful part of $n$. Is it true that $Q_2(n(n+1)\cdots(n+\ell))<n^{2+\epsilon}$? And limits.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/935.lean`.

The definition `powerfulPart` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
