# Erdős Problem 39 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an infinite Sidon set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ such that $\lvert A\cap \{1\ldots,N\}\rvert \gg_\epsilon N^{1/2-\epsilon}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/39.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_39` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a set. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
