# Erdős Problem 1006 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a graph with girth $>4$. Can the edges of $G$ always be directed such that there is no directed cycle, and reversing the direction of any edge also creates no directed cycle?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1006.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the conditions about directed cycles and reversing edges.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
