# Erdős Problem 984 Review

## Problem Statement

Can $\mathbb{N}$ be $2$-coloured such that if $\{a,a+d,\ldots,a+(k-1)d\}$ is a $k$-term monochromatic arithmetic progression then $k\ll_\epsilon a^\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/984.lean`.

The formalization `two_coloring_bounded_ap` asserts: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ C, ∀ i < k, (a + i * d) ^ ε ≤ C * k`.
This says $a^\epsilon \le C k$ (roughly).
The problem says $k \le C a^\epsilon$.
These are opposite inequalities.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
