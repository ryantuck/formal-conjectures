# Review of Erdos Problem 581

## Problem Statement
Let $f(m)$ be the maximum $k$ such that every triangle-free graph on $m$ edges must contain a bipartite subgraph with at least $k$ edges. Determine $f(m)$.
Alon showed $f(m) = m/2 + \Theta(m^{4/5})$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines `maxBipartiteSubgraph` and states Alon's bounds.

```lean
noncomputable def maxBipartiteSubgraph (m : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry

theorem alon_bipartite_subgraph (m : ℕ) :
    ∃ c₁ c₂ : ℝ, c₁ > 0 ∧ c₂ > 0 ∧
      (m : ℝ) / 2 + c₁ * (m : ℝ) ^ (4 / 5) ≤ maxBipartiteSubgraph m ∧
      maxBipartiteSubgraph m ≤ (m : ℝ) / 2 + c₂ * (m : ℝ) ^ (4 / 5) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the result for $f(m)$.
- `maxBipartiteSubgraph` corresponds to $f(m)$.
- The bounds $m/2 + c m^{4/5}$ are correctly expressed.
- The definition of `maxBipartiteSubgraph` is a stub `sorry`, which is fine for the statement, but one should ensure it's defined as "max k such that *every* triangle-free graph...". The name suggests it's a function of $m$.
