# Erdős Problem 981 Review

## Problem Statement

Prove that $\sum_{p<x}f_\epsilon(p)\sim c_\epsilon \frac{x}{\log x}$ where $f_\epsilon(p)$ is the smallest $m$ such that Legendre sum is small.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/981.lean`.

The function `f_ε` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
