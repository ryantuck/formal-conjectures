# Review: Erdos Problem 1103

**Problem:** Growth rate of sequences with squarefree sumsets
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1103](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1103)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let A be an infinite sequence of integers such that every element of A+A is squarefree. How fast must A grow?

Known bounds:
- Lower bound (Konyagin): a_j >> j^{15/11 - o(1)}
- Upper bound (van Doorn-Tao): a_j > 0.24 * j^{4/3}, and there exists a sequence with a_j < exp(5j/log j) for large j.

Erdos also asked whether there exists an infinite sequence A such that for every a in A and prime p, if a = t mod p^2 then 1 <= t < p^2/2.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem squarefree_sumset_growth :
    ∃ (A : ℕ → Finset ℕ),
      (∀ n, ∀ a ∈ A n, ∀ b ∈ A n, Squarefree (a + b)) ∧
      (∀ᶠ n in atTop, (A n).card ≥ n) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Wrong mathematical object (CRITICAL)

The source asks about a single infinite sequence A = {a_1 < a_2 < ...} of integers. The formalization uses `A : ℕ → Finset ℕ`, a family of finite sets indexed by n. This is a completely different object. The source wants one fixed infinite set; the formalization provides a parametrized family of finite sets.

### 2. The question is inverted (CRITICAL)

The source asks: "How fast must A grow?" -- i.e., what is the minimum growth rate of the enumeration function a_j? The formalization asserts the **existence** of a family with growing cardinalities, which seems to ask whether large squarefree-sumset subsets exist. This is closer to the upper bound question (can we find such sequences that don't grow too fast?) but does not capture the lower bound question at all.

### 3. The squarefree condition scope is wrong (CRITICAL)

The source requires that **every** sum a + b with a, b in A is squarefree (i.e., the entire sumset A+A consists of squarefree numbers). The formalization requires `∀ a ∈ A n, ∀ b ∈ A n, Squarefree (a + b)`, which only requires this within each individual finite set A(n), not across a single infinite set.

### 4. Missing growth rate bounds (CRITICAL)

The core of the problem is the growth rate: the known bounds a_j >> j^{15/11-o(1)} (lower) and a_j < exp(5j/log j) (upper). Neither bound appears in the formalization.

### 5. Missing answer elaborator (MINOR)

Since this is an open problem asking "how fast must A grow," it doesn't naturally fit the yes/no `answer(sorry)` pattern, but the formalization should still capture the quantitative bounds.

### 6. Statement is likely trivially true (CRITICAL)

The statement "there exists a family of finite sets where all pairwise sums are squarefree and the sets eventually have cardinality >= n" is trivially achievable. For example, A(n) = {1, 2, ..., n} restricted to elements whose pairwise sums are squarefree -- since most small numbers have squarefree sums, we can find such sets of arbitrary size inside sufficiently large intervals.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- Lower bound on growth: any infinite sequence with squarefree sumset
    must grow at least as fast as j^{4/3}. -/
theorem squarefree_sumset_growth_lower :
    ∀ (A : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono A →
      (∀ i j, Squarefree (A i + A j)) →
        ∃ c > 0, ∀ᶠ j in atTop, (A j : ℝ) ≥ c * (j : ℝ) ^ ((4 : ℝ) / 3) := by
  sorry

/-- Upper bound on growth: there exists an infinite squarefree-sumset sequence
    growing at most exponentially (sub-exponentially in a precise sense). -/
theorem squarefree_sumset_growth_upper :
    ∃ (A : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono A ∧
      (∀ i j, Squarefree (A i + A j)) ∧
        ∀ᶠ j in atTop, (A j : ℝ) < Real.exp (5 * j / Real.log j) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **5%**

The formalization uses a fundamentally wrong mathematical object (family of finite sets vs. a single infinite sequence), the question direction is inverted, the quantitative bounds are entirely missing, and the statement as written is likely trivially true. Only the squarefree pairwise sum condition is partially present.
