# Erdős Problem 992 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $x_n$ be an infinite sequence of integers. Is the discrepancy $D(N)$ bounded by $N^{1/2}(\log N)^\epsilon$ for almost all $\alpha$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/992.lean`.

The theorem `not_discrepancy_bound` asserts the negation of the conjecture (since it's disproved).
It correctly defines the discrepancy condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
