# Erdős Problem 35 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $B$ be an additive basis of order $k$. Is it true that $d_s(A+B) \ge \alpha + \alpha(1-\alpha)/k$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/35.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_35` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this inequality. Matches.
