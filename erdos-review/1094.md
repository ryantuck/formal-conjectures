# Erdős Problem 1094 Review

## Problem Statement
For all $n\geq 2k$ the least prime factor of $\binom{n}{k}$ is $\leq \max(n/k,k)$, with only finitely many exceptions.

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1094.lean` is:
```lean
theorem erdos_1094 :
    {(n, k) : ℕ × ℕ | 0 < k ∧ 2 * k ≤ n ∧ (n.choose k).minFac > max (n / k) k}.Finite := by
  sorry
```
This theorem states that the set of pairs $(n, k)$ satisfying the conditions ($n \ge 2k$, $k > 0$) but violating the conjecture (least prime factor $> \max(n/k, k)$) is finite. This is the correct way to formalize "with only finitely many exceptions".

## Completeness
The formalization is complete and faithful to the problem statement.

## Confidence
100%
