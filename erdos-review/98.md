# Erdős Problem 98 Review

## Problem Statement

For points in general position (no 3 on line, no 4 on circle), does $h(n)/n \to \infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/98.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_98` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this limit. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
