# Erdős Problem 944 Review

## Problem Statement

Must there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ such that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>r$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/944.lean`.

The definition `IsErdos944` captures the properties: $k$-chromatic, vertex critical (`IsCritical k` typically implies vertex criticality), and edge critical sets have size $>r$.
The theorem `erdos_944` asks for existence of such graphs for all $k \ge 4, r \ge 1$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
