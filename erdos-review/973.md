# Erdős Problem 973 Review

## Problem Statement

Does there exist a constant $C>1$ such that, for every $n\geq 2$, there exists a sequence $z_i\in \mathbb{C}$ with $z_1=1$ and $\lvert z_ivert \geq 1$ with $\max_{2\leq k\leq n+1}\left\lvert \sum_{1\leq i\leq n}z_i^kightvert < C^{-n}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/973.lean`.

The theorem `complex_power_sum_bounds` quantifies `∀ k : ℕ` in the conclusion `‖∑ i : Fin n, (z i) ^ k‖ < C ^ (-(n : ℝ))`.
The problem only requires this bound for $2 \le k \le n+1$.
Requiring it for all $k$ makes the statement false and does not match the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
