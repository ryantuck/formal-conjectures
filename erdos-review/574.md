# Review of Erdos Problem 574

## Problem Statement
Is it true that for $k \ge 2$,
$$ \mathrm{ex}(n; \{C_{2k-1}, C_{2k}\}) = (1+o(1))(n/2)^{1+1/k}? $$

## Lean Formalization
The formalization uses asymptotic equivalence.

```lean
theorem extremal_consecutive_cycles (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ (fun (n : ℕ) => (extremalNumber n (fun G => avoidsConsecutiveCycles k G) : ℝ)) ~[Filter.atTop]
      (fun n => ((n : ℝ) / 2) ^ (1 + 1 / (k : ℝ))) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `(1+o(1))` is equivalent to asymptotic equivalence `~`.
- The exponent $1+1/k$ and base $n/2$ are correct.
- `avoidsConsecutiveCycles` correctly checks for $C_{2k-1}$ and $C_{2k}$.
