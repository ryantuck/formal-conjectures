# Erdős Problem 1026 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a sequence of distinct real numbers. Determine $\max\left(\sum x_{i_r}ight)$, where the maximum is taken over all monotonic subsequences.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1026.lean`.

The formalization asks for a constant $c$ such that for any sequence `seq`, there exists a subsequence `subseq` such that `(Monotone ... ∨ Antitone ...) → ...`.
The implication `→` is misplaced. It should be: there exists a subsequence which IS monotonic AND has a large sum.
Also, the problem is about determining the *maximum possible sum* of a monotonic subsequence for a *given* sequence (minimized over all sequences? No, just "Determine..."). Usually this implies finding a bound in terms of $n$ and the values?
Wait, the problem text says "Determine max(sum)". This likely means "Find the minimum over all sequences of the maximum sum of a monotonic subsequence".
The formalization: `c / Real.sqrt n * (Finset.range n).sum seq ≤ subseq.sum seq`. This compares the subsequence sum to the total sum.
However, the `(Monotone ... ∨ Antitone ...)` is a hypothesis for the conclusion, not a property of the existential `subseq`. This means if the whole sequence happens to be monotonic, then the bound holds. This is trivial and not what is asked.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
