# Erdős Problem 909 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $n\geq 2$. Is there a space $S$ of dimension $n$ such that $S^2$ also has dimension $n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/909.lean`.

The theorem `square_same_dimension` states:
`∃ (S : Type) (_: TopologicalSpace S) (n : ℕ), ∃ (dimS dimS2 : ℕ), dimS = n ∧ dimS2 = n`
This merely asserts the existence of a type $S$ and numbers $n, dimS, dimS2$ such that $n=n$.
It does **not** link `dimS` to the actual dimension of the space $S$. There is no dimension function used.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect/vacuously true.
