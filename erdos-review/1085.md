# Erdős Problem 1085 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_d(n)$ be minimal such that, in any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist at most $f_d(n)$ pairs of points which distance $1$ apart. Estimate $f_d(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1085.lean`.

The function `f (d n : ℕ)` is correctly defined as the maximum number of unit distance pairs in a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
The formalization includes multiple theorems representing known results and conjectures for dimensions $d=2, 3, 4, \dots$, matching the detailed problem context.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
