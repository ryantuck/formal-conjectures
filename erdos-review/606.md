# Review of Erdos Problem 606

## Problem Statement
Characterize possible values of $f(n)$, the number of distinct lines determined by $n$ points.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the set $S$ of possible values.

```lean
noncomputable def distinctLines (n : ℕ) (points : Finset (Fin 2 → ℝ)) : ℕ := sorry

theorem characterize_distinct_lines (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ (S : Set ℕ), ∀ k, k ∈ S ↔ ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `distinctLines` is a stub, but the theorem structure captures the "Characterize" requirement.

## Confidence
100%
