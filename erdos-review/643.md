# Review of Erdos Problem 643

## Problem Statement
Estimate $f(n;t)$ for t-uniform hypergraphs containing disjoint unions $A \cup B = C \cup D$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for bounds.

```lean
noncomputable def f (n t : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem hypergraph_edge_property ... c₁ * sorry ≤ f n t ∧ f n t ≤ c₂ * sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton. The specific edge property is not in the code. Bounds are `sorry`.

## Confidence
50% (Skeleton)
