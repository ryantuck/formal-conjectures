# Erdős Problem 1087 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contains at most $f(n)$ many sets of four points which are 'degenerate' in the sense that some pair are the same distance apart. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1087.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the function $f(n)$ or the degeneracy condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
