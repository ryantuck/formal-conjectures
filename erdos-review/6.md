# Erdős Problem 6 Review

## Problem Statement

There are infinitely many $n$ such that $d_n < d_{n+1} < d_{n+2}$, where $d$ denotes the prime gap function.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/6.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_6` asserts that the set of $n$ satisfying the inequality chain for prime gaps is infinite. This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
