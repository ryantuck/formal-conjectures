# Review: Erdos Problem 1145

**Problem:** Sumset containment and convolution growth (Erdos-Sarkozy conjecture)
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1145](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1145)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let A = {1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ...} and B = {1 ≤ b_1 < b_2 < ...} be sets of integers with a_n/b_n → 1. If A + B contains all sufficiently large positive integers, must lim sup (1_A * 1_B)(n) = ∞? (Here * denotes convolution: (1_A * 1_B)(n) = |{(a,b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B, a + b = n}|.)

This is a conjecture of Erdos and Sarkozy, a stronger form of Problem 28. A counterexample shows the condition a_n/b_n → 1 is necessary: if A has only even binary digits and B has only odd binary digits, then 1_A * 1_B(n) = 1 for all n.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem sumset_convolution_growth :
    ∃ (A B : Set ℕ), answer(sorry) ↔
      ({a + b | (a : ℕ) (b : ℕ) (_ : a ∈ A) (_ : b ∈ B)} ⊆ A ∧
       ∀ n : ℕ, n ∈ B → n > 0) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely wrong mathematical content (CRITICAL)

The source asks a UNIVERSAL question: for ALL pairs of sets A, B satisfying certain conditions, must a conclusion hold? The formalization uses an EXISTENTIAL quantifier `∃ (A B : Set ℕ)`, asking whether SOME particular A, B exist with a property. The quantifier is inverted.

### 2. Missing the condition a_n/b_n → 1 (CRITICAL)

The central hypothesis — that the n-th elements of A and B grow at the same rate (a_n/b_n → 1) — is completely absent from the formalization.

### 3. Missing the condition A + B contains all large integers (CRITICAL)

The hypothesis that A + B is an additive basis (contains all sufficiently large integers) is absent. Instead, the formalization has `A + B ⊆ A`, which says the sumset is contained IN A — a completely different and much stronger condition (making A a subsemigroup).

### 4. Missing the conclusion about convolution growth (CRITICAL)

The source's conclusion is `lim sup (1_A * 1_B)(n) = ∞`, meaning the number of representations n = a + b (a ∈ A, b ∈ B) is unbounded. The formalization has no convolution, no representation count, and no lim sup. The RHS is just `A + B ⊆ A ∧ ∀ n ∈ B, n > 0`, which has no connection to the source problem.

### 5. Placeholder formalization (CRITICAL)

The entire statement has no meaningful connection to the source problem. It appears to be a placeholder where the AI tool could not determine the correct formalization.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- Representation count: number of ways to write n = a + b with a ∈ A, b ∈ B -/
noncomputable def representationCount (A B : Set ℕ) (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  Nat.card {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 ∈ A ∧ p.2 ∈ B ∧ p.1 + p.2 = n}

        (∀ᶠ n in Filter.atTop, ∃ i j, a i + b j = n) →
        Filter.atTop.limsup (fun n => (representationCount (Set.range a) (Set.range b) n : EReal)) = ⊤ := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

The formalization bears essentially no resemblance to the source problem. Every key component is missing or wrong: the quantifier direction (existential vs universal), the growth-rate condition (a_n/b_n → 1), the additive basis hypothesis (A + B covers all large integers), and the convolution-growth conclusion (lim sup = ∞). The RHS condition (A + B ⊆ A with positive elements in B) is unrelated to the source. This needs a complete rewrite.
