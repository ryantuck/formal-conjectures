# Erdős Problem 950 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n) = \sum_{p<n}\frac{1}{n-p}$. Is it true that $\liminf f(n)=1$ and $\limsup f(n)=\infty$? Is it true that $f(n)=o(\log\log n)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/950.lean`.

The theorem `f_limit_properties` correctly combines the questions about liminf, limsup, and asymptotic growth order.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
