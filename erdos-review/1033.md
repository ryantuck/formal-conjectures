# Erdős Problem 1033 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $h(n)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $>n^2/4$ many edges contains a triangle whose vertices have degrees summing to at least $h(n)$. Estimate $h(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1033.lean`.

The function `h` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
