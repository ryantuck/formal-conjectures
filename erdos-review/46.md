# Erdős Problem 46 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every finite colouring of the integers have a monochromatic solution to $1=\sum \frac{1}{n_i}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/46.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_46` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this. Matches.
