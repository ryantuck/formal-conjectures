# Erdős Problem 18 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many practical $m$ such that $h(m) < (\log \log m)^{O(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/18.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_18` formalizes this asymptotic bound question for practical numbers.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
