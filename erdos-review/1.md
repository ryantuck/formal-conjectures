# Erdős Problem 1 Review

## Problem Statement

If $A\subseteq\{1, ..., N\}$ with $|A| = n$ is such that the subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$ then $N \gg 2 ^ n$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1.lean`.

The conjecture `erdos_1` asserts the existence of a constant $C > 0$ such that for any such set $A$ (defined by `IsSumDistinctSet`), $N > C \cdot 2^{|A|}$. This correctly captures the asymptotic lower bound $N \gg 2^n$.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
