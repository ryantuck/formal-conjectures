# Review of Erdos Problem 601

## Problem Statement
For which limit ordinals $\alpha$ is it true that every graph with vertex set $\alpha$ must contain either an infinite path or an independent set of order type $\alpha$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization sets up the structure for the property.

```lean
theorem limit_ordinal_path_or_independent (α : Ordinal.{0}) (hlimit : α.IsLimit) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ (G : SimpleGraph α.toType),
      (∃ (path : Set α.toType), sorry) ∨
      (∃ (indep : Set α.toType), sorry) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton (`sorry` in the conditions). The "infinite path" and "independent set of order type $\alpha$" are not fully formalized.
- "infinite path": `∃ (path : Set α.toType), sorry`.
- "independent set of order type $\alpha$": `∃ (indep : Set α.toType), sorry`.
- The intent is clear, but the implementation is missing.
