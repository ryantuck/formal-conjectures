# Review of Erdos Problem 596

## Problem Statement
For which pairs $(G_1, G_2)$ is it true that:
(a) $\forall n \ge 1, \exists G_1$-free $H$ s.t. $H \to (G_2)^2_n$? (Actually problem says edges $n$-colored)
(b) $\forall G_1$-free $H, H \not\to (G_2)^2_{\aleph_0}$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization is a stub.

```lean
theorem ramsey_dichotomy_pairs (G₁ G₂ : SimpleGraph ℕ) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely. It does not capture the complex conditions (a) and (b).
