# Review of Erdos Problem 638

## Problem Statement
Family $S$ of finite graphs where $G_n \in S$ forces monochromatic triangle with $n$ colors.
Is there an infinite graph $G$ such that every finite subgraph is in $S$, and if edges of $G$ colored with $\aleph$ colors, there is a monochromatic triangle?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization is a stub.

```lean
theorem infinite_cardinal_triangle_property (κ : Cardinal.{0}) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∃ (V : Type) ... sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization does not capture the complex condition relating $S$, finite subgraphs, and the coloring property.
