# Erdős Problem 40 Review

## Problem Statement

For what functions $g(N) \to \infty$ is it true that $\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \gg \frac{N^{1/2}}{g(N)}$ implies $\limsup 1_A\ast 1_A(n)=\infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/40.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_40` asks for the set of functions satisfying this property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the answer, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
