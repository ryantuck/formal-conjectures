# Review of Erdos Problem 611

## Problem Statement
If all maximal cliques have size $\ge cn$, is $\tau(G) = o_c(n)$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization tests this implication.

```lean
theorem large_cliques_small_transversal (c : ℝ) (hc : 0 < c ∧ c < 1) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop,
      ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
        (∀ (clique : Finset (Fin n)), sorry → clique.card ≥ Nat.floor (c * n)) →
        (cliqueTransversal G : ℝ) < ε * (n : ℝ) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `sorry` in `∀ clique, sorry → ...` likely stands for `IsMaximalClique clique`.
- Conclusion `o(n)` captured by `< ε * n` for large `n`.

## Confidence
