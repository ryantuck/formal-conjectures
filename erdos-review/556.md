# Review of Erdos Problem 556

## Problem Statement
Let $R_3(G)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $3$-coloured then there must be a monochromatic copy of $G$. Show that
$$R_3(C_n) \leq 4n-3.$$

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `three_color_cycle_bound` using `Filter.atTop` but concludes with `sorry`.

```lean
theorem three_color_cycle_bound :
    ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop, sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R_3(C_n)$ is not defined.
- The inequality is not expressed.
- The problem does not explicitly state "for sufficiently large n", but the note "verified for sufficiently large n" might suggest it. However, the formalization is still a stub.
