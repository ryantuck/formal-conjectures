# Erdős Problem 80 Review

## Problem Statement

Estimate the size of the largest book in a graph with $cn^2$ edges.

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/80.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_80` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the polynomial bound $n^\epsilon$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
