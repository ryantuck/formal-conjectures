# Review of Erdos Problem 563

## Problem Statement
Let $F(n,\alpha)$ denote the smallest $m$ such that there exists a 2-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ so that every $X \subseteq [n]$ with $|X| \ge m$ contains more than $\alpha \binom{|X|}{2}$ edges of each colour.
Prove that for every $0 \le \alpha < 1/2$, $F(n,\alpha) \sim c_\alpha \log n$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines a stub `F` and then the theorem `f_asymptotic_log`.

```lean
def F (n : ℕ) (α : ℝ) : ℕ := sorry

theorem f_asymptotic_log (α : ℝ) (hα : 0 ≤ α ∧ α < 1/2) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ (fun n => (F n α : ℝ)) ~[atTop] fun n => c * Real.log n :=
  sorry
```

## Critique
The statement matches the problem well.
- `F` is defined (as a stub) with the correct signature.
- The asymptotic relation `~[atTop]` matches the $\sim$ in the problem.
- The existence of constant $c$ is correctly quantified.
