# Review of Erdos Problem 588

## Problem Statement
Let $f_k(n)$ be the minimal such that if $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have no $k+1$ points on a line then there must be at most $f_k(n)$ many lines containing at least $k$ points. Is it true that $f_k(n) = o(n^2)$ for $k \ge 4$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines `f_k` (stub) and the conjecture.

```lean
noncomputable def f_k (k n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry

theorem lines_with_k_points_subquadratic (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 4) (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop,
      (f_k k n : ℝ) < ε * (n : ℝ) ^ 2 := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the question "Is it true that $f_k(n) = o(n^2)$?".
- `f_k` definition stub is sufficient for the structure.
- `∀ ε > 0, ... < ε * n^2` is the definition of $o(n^2)$.

## Confidence
100%
