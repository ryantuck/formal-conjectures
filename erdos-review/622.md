# Review of Erdos Problem 622

## Problem Statement
Regular graph $2n$, degree $n+1$. Must have $\gg 2^{2n}$ subsets spanned by a cycle?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts this.

```lean
theorem regular_graph_cycle_spanned_subsets ...
    ∃ (subsets : Finset (Finset (Fin (2*n)))),
      (∀ S ∈ subsets, ∃ (w : G.Walk sorry sorry), sorry) ∧
      ... ≥ (1 / 2) * 2 ^ (2 * m)
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- "spanned by a cycle": `∃ w, ...`.
- Bound is correct.

## Confidence
90% (Stubbed cycle condition)
