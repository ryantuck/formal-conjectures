# Review of Erdos Problem 590

## Problem Statement
Let $\alpha = \omega^\omega$. Is it true that in any red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_\alpha$ there is either a red $K_\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization uses `OrdinalCardinalRamsey` to express the partition relation.

```lean
theorem erdos_590 : OrdinalCardinalRamsey (ω ^ ω) (ω ^ ω) 3 := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `OrdinalCardinalRamsey (ω ^ ω) (ω ^ ω) 3` corresponds to $\omega^\omega \to (\omega^\omega, 3)^2$ (or in this library's notation, partition of edges of size $\alpha$ gives homogenenous set of size $\alpha$ or 3).
- Note: The problem asks "Is it true?". The theorem asserts it is true (Chang's result).
