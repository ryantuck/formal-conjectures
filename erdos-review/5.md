# Erdős Problem 5 Review

## Problem Statement

De Polignac's conjecture: For every positive even integer $2k$, there are infinitely many consecutive primes $p_n, p_{n+1}$ such that $p_{n+1} - p_n = 2k$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/5.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_5` asserts that for all $k > 0$, the set of indices $n$ where `primeGap n = 2 * k` is infinite. This correctly formalizes the conjecture.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
