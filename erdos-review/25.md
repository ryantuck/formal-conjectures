# Erdős Problem 25 Review

## Problem Statement

Must the logarithmic density of $A$ exist, where $A$ is defined by a sequence of size-dependent congruences?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/25.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_25` asks if `answer(sorry)` is equivalent to the existence of logarithmic density for the defined set.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
