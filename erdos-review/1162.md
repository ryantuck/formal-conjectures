# Review: Erdos Problem 1162

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1162.lean`
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1162](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1162)
**Status:** OPEN (but asymptotic constant established)

## Original Problem

Let $f(n)$ denote the number of subgroups of $S_n$. Give an asymptotic formula for $f(n)$.

Known results:
- Pyber (1993): $\log f(n) \asymp n^2$
- Roney-Dougal and Tracey (2025): $\log f(n) = (1/16 + o(1))n^2$

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem subgroups_symmetric_group_asymptotic :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ),
        (fun n => Real.log (f n)) ~[atTop] (fun n => (1/16 : ℝ) * (n : ℝ)^2) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry)` for open problem |
| Asymptotic formula | Yes | `~[atTop]` with $n^2/16$ |
| Logarithmic scale | Yes | `Real.log (f n)` |
| Correct constant $1/16$ | Yes | `(1/16 : ℝ)` |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 20]` |

### Critical issues

1. **Trivially true (Critical):** Take $f(n) = \lceil e^{n^2/16} \rceil$. The existential is satisfied. No connection to actual subgroups of $S_n$.

2. **f(n) is a specific function:** The count of subgroups of $S_n$ is well-defined. In Lean, one could define it using `Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` and counting equivalence classes (though this would require decidability infrastructure).

3. **Status question:** The website says OPEN, but the Roney-Dougal & Tracey 2025 result establishes the asymptotic formula $\log f(n) = (1/16 + o(1))n^2$. If this result is confirmed, the problem should arguably be `answer(True)` and `@[category research solved]`. However, the original problem also asks "Is there a statistical theorem on their order?" which may remain open.

### Good aspects

- The asymptotic notation `~[atTop]` correctly expresses $\log f(n) \sim n^2/16$, i.e., $\log f(n) / (n^2/16) \to 1$.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 10%**

Correct asymptotic form with the right constant, but trivially satisfiable. The function $f(n)$ should be defined, not existentially quantified.
