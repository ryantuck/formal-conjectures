# Erdős Problem 1013 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $h_3(k)$ be the minimal $n$ such that there exists a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $k$. Find an asymptotic for $h_3(k)$, and also prove $\lim_{k	o \infty}\frac{h_3(k+1)}{h_3(k)}=1$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1013.lean`.

The function `h_3` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
