# Erdős Problem 921 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_k(n)$ be the largest $m$ such that there is a graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $k$ in which every odd cycle has length $> m$. Is it true that $f_k(n) \asymp n^{\frac{1}{k-2}}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/921.lean`.

The theorem `chromatic_odd_cycle` merely asserts that if $\chi(G) \ge k$, there exists an odd cycle of length $\ge k$. This is a well-known (and weak) bound.
It does not define $f_k(n)$ or address the asymptotic growth $n^{1/(k-2)}$ related to the graph size $n$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
