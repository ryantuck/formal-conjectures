# Review of Erdos Problem 612

## Problem Statement
Prove diameter bounds for connected graphs with min degree $d$ that are $K_{2r}$-free or $K_{2r+1}$-free.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the bound holds.

```lean
theorem diameter_bound_k_free ...
    (hfree : ∀ (f : Fin k ↪ α), ¬ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → G.Adj (f i) (f j)) :
    (sorry : ℕ) ≤ (sorry : ℕ) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton.
- $K_k$-free condition is correct.
- Bounds are stubbed (`sorry ≤ sorry`).

## Confidence
80% (Bounds not transcribed)
