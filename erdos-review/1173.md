## Original Problem

Under GCH, let $f: \omega_{\omega+1} \to [\omega_{\omega+1}]^{\leq \aleph_\omega}$ be a function such that $|f(\alpha) \cap f(\beta)| < \aleph_\omega$ for all $\alpha \neq \beta$.

Does there exist a free set of cardinality $\aleph_{\omega+1}$?

A free set $S$ satisfies: for distinct $\alpha, \beta \in S$, $\alpha \notin f(\beta)$ and $\beta \notin f(\alpha)$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem free_set_under_gch :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (omega_omega_plus_one : Type*) [Infinite omega_omega_plus_one],
      ∀ (f : omega_omega_plus_one → Set omega_omega_plus_one),
        (∀ α β : omega_omega_plus_one, α ≠ β → (f α ∩ f β).Finite) →
        ∃ (S : Set omega_omega_plus_one),
          ∀ α β : omega_omega_plus_one, α ∈ S → β ∈ S → α ≠ β →
            α ∉ f β ∧ β ∉ f α := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry) ↔` is correct |
| Function mapping elements to sets of elements | Yes | `f : omega_omega_plus_one → Set omega_omega_plus_one` |
| Bounded pairwise intersection | Partially | `(f α ∩ f β).Finite` is present but wrong bound |
| Free set definition | Yes | `α ∉ f β ∧ β ∉ f α` is correct |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 03]` |

### Issues

1. **GCH not captured:** The problem is stated under GCH. The formalization does not encode this set-theoretic hypothesis.

2. **Cardinality of ω_{ω+1} missing:** The type just has `[Infinite]`, with no constraint making it specifically ℵ_{ω+1}.

3. **Bounded image size missing:** The original requires $f(\alpha) \in [\omega_{\omega+1}]^{\leq \aleph_\omega}$, meaning each $f(\alpha)$ has cardinality at most $\aleph_\omega$. The formalization places no constraint on the size of individual images.

4. **Intersection bound is too strong:** The original says $|f(\alpha) \cap f(\beta)| < \aleph_\omega$ — cardinality strictly less than $\aleph_\omega$, which includes all sets of cardinality up to $\aleph_n$ for any finite $n$. The formalization uses `(f α ∩ f β).Finite`, which means *finite* — a much stronger condition. The gap is enormous: $< \aleph_\omega$ allows countably infinite and much larger intersections, while `.Finite` requires finitely many elements.

5. **Free set cardinality missing:** The original asks for a free set of cardinality $\aleph_{\omega+1}$ — the same cardinality as the ground set. The formalization only asks for existence of *some* free set, with no size constraint. A free set of size 1 trivially exists.

### Good aspects

- The free set condition `α ∉ f β ∧ β ∉ f α` is faithfully captured
- The overall structure (function, intersection hypothesis, free set conclusion) is correct
- The docstring clearly explains the problem

## Verdict

**Confidence: 20%**

The structural skeleton is sound — a function on a large set with bounded pairwise intersections, seeking a large free set. However, the intersection bound is off by a massive gap (finite vs. $< \aleph_\omega$), the image size constraint is missing, the free set needs a cardinality requirement, and the specific cardinalities ($\aleph_{\omega+1}$, $\aleph_\omega$) are absent.
