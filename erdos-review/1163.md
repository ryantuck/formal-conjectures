# Review: Erdos Problem 1163

**Status:** OPEN

## Original Problem

"Describe (by statistical means) the arithmetic structure of the orders of subgroups of $S_n$."

A problem of Erdos and Turan. The website acknowledges ambiguity in the original formulation.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem arithmetic_structure_subgroup_orders :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (orders : ℕ → Finset ℕ),
        (∀ n : ℕ, ∀ d ∈ orders n, d ∣ n.factorial) ∧
        (∀ n : ℕ, (orders n).Nonempty) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry)` for open problem |
| Divisibility condition | Partially | `d ∣ n.factorial` is a necessary condition |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 20]` |

### Critical issues

1. **Trivially true (Critical):** Take `orders(n) = {1}`. Then $1 \mid n!$ and the set is nonempty. The statement has no mathematical content.

2. **Problem is inherently vague:** "Describe by statistical means" does not lend itself to a precise formal statement. The website itself acknowledges uncertainty about the intended interpretation.

3. **No statistical content:** The formalization captures a basic necessary condition (orders divide $n!$) but nothing about statistical distribution, density, or arithmetic structure. A meaningful formalization might involve:
   - Asymptotic density of the set of subgroup orders among all divisors of $n!$
   - Distribution of prime factorizations
   - Growth rate of the count of distinct subgroup orders

4. **Nonemptiness is trivial:** `(orders n).Nonempty` adds nothing since $\{e\}$ is always a subgroup.

### Mitigating context

The docstring honestly acknowledges the vagueness: "The problem statement is somewhat vague." This is a case where the original problem may not be formalizable in a meaningful way.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 3%**

The problem is inherently vague, and the formalization is trivially true. The divisibility condition is a correct but vacuous necessary condition. This is arguably the hardest problem in the batch to formalize meaningfully.
