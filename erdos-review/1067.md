# Erdős Problem 1067 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ contain an infinitely connected subgraph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1067.lean`.

The formalization translates the question into `∀ (V : Type) (G : SimpleGraph V), G.chromaticNumber = aleph 1 → ∃ (H : G.Subgraph), H.coe.chromaticNumber = aleph 1 ∧ InfinitelyConnected H.coe`.
This correctly captures the "chromatic number $\aleph_1$" condition and the existence of a subgraph with the same chromatic number and infinite connectivity.
The term `InfinitelyConnected` corresponds to vertex connectivity $\ge \aleph_0$. The file also includes a variant for infinite edge-connectivity.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
