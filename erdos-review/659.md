# Review of Erdos Problem 659

## Problem Statement
Set of $n$ points where every 4 determine $\ge 3$ distances, total distinct $\ll n/\sqrt{\log n}$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks if such set exists.

```lean
theorem erdos_659 : answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ A : ℕ → Finset ℝ²,
   ... (∀ S ⊆ A n, #S = 4 → 3 ≤ distinctDistances S) ∧
    (fun n ↦ distinctDistances (A n)) ≪ fun n ↦ n / sqrt (log n)
```

## Critique
The formalization is precise.
- `distinctDistances` assumed defined.
- Conditions match.

## Confidence
100%
