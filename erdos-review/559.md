# Review of Erdos Problem 559

## Problem Statement
Let $\hat{R}(G)$ denote the size Ramsey number, the minimal number of edges $m$ such that there is a graph $H$ with $m$ edges that is Ramsey for $G$.
If $G$ has $n$ vertices and maximum degree $d$ then prove that
$$\hat{R}(G)\ll_d n.$$

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `size_ramsey_bounded_degree_counterexample` as `answer(False) ↔ sorry`.

```lean
theorem size_ramsey_bounded_degree_counterexample :
    answer(False) ↔ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(G)$ is not defined.
- The asymptotic bound $\ll_d n$ is not expressed.
- The fact that the problem is disproved (and thus the answer is "False") is hinted at by `answer(False)`, but the statement itself (which should be the negation of the original conjecture, or a counterexample) is not formalized.
