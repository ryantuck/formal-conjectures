# Erdős Problem 51 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an infinite set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $a \in A$, there is an integer n such that $\phi(n)=a$, and $n_a/a \to \infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/51.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_51` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a set. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
