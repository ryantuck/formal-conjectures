# Erdős Problem 920 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_k(n)$ be the maximum possible chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices which contains no $K_k$. Is it true that $f_k(n) \gg \frac{n^{1-\frac{1}{k-1}}}{(\log n)^{c_k}}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/920.lean`.

The formalization defines `h(k, r)` as the minimum vertices for a $K_k$-free graph with chromatic number $r$ (inverse function of $f_k$).
The theorem asks about the limit of the ratio `h(k, r+1)/h(k,r)`.
While related to the growth of $f_k(n)$, this is a different specific question.
Moreover, `h` is a placeholder (`sorry`).

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
