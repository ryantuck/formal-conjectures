# Review of Erdos Problem 587

## Problem Statement
What is the size of the largest $A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ such that for all $\emptyset \neq S \subseteq A$, $\sum_{n \in S} n$ is not a square?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines `MaxNotSqSum` and states the Nguyen-Vu bound.

```lean
def MaxNotSqSum (N : ℕ) : ℕ :=
    (Finset.Icc 1 N |>.powerset.filter fun A => ∀ S ⊆ A, S ≠ ⊥ →
      ¬ IsSquare (∑ n ∈ S, n)).sup Finset.card

theorem erdos_587.variants.nguyen_vu : ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is precise.
- `MaxNotSqSum` definition matches the problem statement exactly.
- The theorem gives the asymptotic bound.

## Confidence
