# Review of Erdos Problem 648

## Problem Statement
Estimate $g(n)$, the length of the longest chain $a_1 < \dots < a_t < n$ with decreasing greatest prime factors.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines $g(n)$ stub and bounds.

```lean
noncomputable def g (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem longest_decreasing_prime_factors ... c₁ * sqrt(n/log n) ≤ g n ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `g` stubbed.
- Bounds match solution.

## Confidence
100%
