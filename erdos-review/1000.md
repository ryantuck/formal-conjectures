# Erdős Problem 1000 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A=\{n_1<n_2<\cdots\}$ be an infinite sequence of integers, and let $\phi_A(k)$ count the number of $1\leq m\leq n_k$ such that the fraction $\frac{m}{n_k}$ does not have denominator $n_j$ for $j<k$ when written in lowest form. Is there a sequence $A$ such that $\lim_{N	o \infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\leq N}\frac{\phi_A(k)}{n_k}=0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1000.lean`.

The function `phi_A` is correctly defined as counting $m \in [1, n_k]$ such that for all $j < k$, the denominator of $m/n_k$ (which is $n_k / \gcd(m, n_k)$) is not equal to $n_j$.
The theorem `erdos_1000_haight` asserts the existence of a sequence $A$ satisfying the limit condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.
