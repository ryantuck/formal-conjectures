# Erdős Problem 958 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that $k=n-1$ and $\{f(d_i)\}=\{n-1,\ldots,1\}$ if and only if $A$ is a set of equidistant points on a line or a circle?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/958.lean`.

The theorem `not_equidistant_characterization` states `¬ ∀ ... (f(d) condition) → Collinear ∨ Concyclic`.
This asserts that the distance frequency condition does *not* imply line/circle structure (disproving the "if" direction of "iff").
Since the problem asks "Is it true?", and the answer is "No" (Disproved), formalizing the negation is correct.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
