# Review of Erdos Problem 603

## Problem Statement
Let $(A_i)$ be countably infinite sets with $|A_i \cap A_j| \neq 2$. Find smallest cardinal $C$ such that $\cup A_i$ is $C$-colorable with no monochromatic $A_i$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of such a cardinal.

```lean
theorem min_cardinal_intersection_not_two :
    ∃ (C : Cardinal),
      (∀ (family : ℕ → Set ℕ), ... → ∃ (coloring : ℕ → Fin sorry), sorry) ∧
      (∀ C' < C, ∃ (family : ℕ → Set ℕ), sorry) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization structure is correct for "Find smallest cardinal".
- The conditions are stubbed (`sorry`), but the logical quantifier structure for minimization is correct.

## Confidence
90% (Stubbed conditions)
