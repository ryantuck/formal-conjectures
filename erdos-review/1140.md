# Review: Erdos Problem 1140

**Problem:** Infinitely many n with n - 2x² prime for all valid x
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1140](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1140)
**Status:** DISPROVED

## Source Problem

Do there exist infinitely many integers n such that n - 2x² is prime for all x satisfying 2x² < n?

Known: The answer is No. The complete list of known values is 2, 5, 7, 13, 31, 61, 181, 199. Epure and Gica proved that for n ≡ 1 (mod 4), only 5, 13, 61, 181 qualify; for n ≡ 3 (mod 4), only 7, 31, 199 plus at most one exception.

## Current Formalization

```lean
def satisfiesCondition (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : ℕ, 2 * x^2 < n → (n - 2 * x^2).Prime

@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem erdos_1140 :
    answer(True) ↔ {n : ℕ | satisfiesCondition n}.Finite := by
  sorry

@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem known_solutions :
    {2, 5, 7, 13, 31, 61, 181, 199} ⊆ {n : ℕ | satisfiesCondition n} := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. satisfiesCondition definition is correct (GOOD)

`∀ x : ℕ, 2 * x^2 < n → (n - 2 * x^2).Prime` correctly checks that n - 2x² is prime for all non-negative x with 2x² < n. Since 2x² < n guarantees the ℕ subtraction doesn't underflow, the definition is safe. Note that x = 0 gives n itself must be prime (since n - 0 = n), which is a strong condition. This matches the source.

### 2. answer(True) usage is reasonable (GOOD)

The original question is "Do infinitely many exist?" which was disproved (answer: No). The formalization rephrases as "Is the set finite?" and uses `answer(True)`, meaning the answer to "is it finite?" is Yes. This correctly encodes the disproof. An alternative approach would be `answer(False) ↔ Set.Infinite {n | ...}`, but both are logically equivalent.

### 3. Known solutions theorem is a nice addition (GOOD)

The `known_solutions` theorem asserting {2, 5, 7, 13, 31, 61, 181, 199} ⊆ {n | satisfiesCondition n} provides verifiable mathematical content beyond the main conjecture. These match the known values from the source.

### 4. x = 0 case (MINOR)

When x = 0, the condition becomes `0 < n → n.Prime`. This means every qualifying n must itself be prime. Among the known solutions: 2, 5, 7, 13, 31, 61, 181, 199 are all prime. This is consistent.

### 5. Category tag is correct (GOOD)

`@[category research solved, AMS 11]` correctly marks this as a solved problem in number theory.

### 6. Finiteness vs explicit upper bound (MINOR)

The formalization only asserts finiteness, not that there are at most 9 such values (or that the known list is complete with at most one exception). A stronger formalization could bound the cardinality, but finiteness is sufficient to capture the main result.

## Confidence: **85%**

The formalization correctly captures the core question and its negative resolution. The `satisfiesCondition` definition faithfully models the source, the ℕ subtraction is safe under the hypothesis, the `answer(True)` correctly encodes the disproof, and the known solutions are accurately listed. The only minor issues are stylistic (rephrasing the question as finiteness rather than negating infiniteness) and the lack of an explicit cardinality bound.
