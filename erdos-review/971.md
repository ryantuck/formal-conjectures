# Erdős Problem 971 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $p(a,d)$ be the least prime congruent to $a\pmod{d}$. Does there exist a constant $c>0$ such that, for all large $d$, $p(a,d) > (1+c)\phi(d)\log d$ for $\gg \phi(d)$ many values of $a$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/971.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_971` correctly quantifies over $d$ and counts the number of residues $a$ satisfying the bound.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
