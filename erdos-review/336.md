Limit of $h(r)/r^2$ for exact order of bases.

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/336.lean`.

The theorems `erdos_336_grekos_lower` and `_nash_upper` assert bounds on the limit. Matches.

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proofs, but the statements are complete.

## Confidence

100%
