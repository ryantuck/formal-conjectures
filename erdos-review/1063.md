# Erdős Problem 1063 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 2$ and define $n_k\geq 2k$ to be the least value of $n$ such that $n-i$ divides $\binom{n}{k}$ for all but one $0\leq i < k$. Estimate $n_k$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1063.lean`.

The value $n_k$ is formalized as `n (k : ℕ)`, defined as the infimum of the set of integers $m \ge 2k$ satisfying the condition.
The condition "all but one $0 \le i < k$" is formalized as `∃ i0 < k, ¬ (m - i0) ∣ m.choose k ∧ ∀ i < k, i ≠ i0 → (m - i) ∣ m.choose k`. This correctly captures the "exactly one exception" requirement.

The problem asks to "Estimate $n_k$". The formalization includes several theorems establishing bounds and an open problem `better_upper` which seeks an improved upper bound. This is a reasonable interpretation of the open-ended request.

## Completeness

The formalization accurately defines the sequence $n_k$ and frames the estimation problem as finding better bounds.
