# Review: Erdos Problem 1142

**Problem:** Infinitely many n with n - 2^k prime for all valid k
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1142](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1142)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Are there infinitely many integers n (or at any rate, any n > 105) such that n - 2^k is prime for all 1 < 2^k < n?

Known: Only seven such n are known: 4, 7, 15, 21, 45, 75, 105 (OEIS A039669). Mientka and Weitzenkamp proved no others exist up to 2^44. Vaughan proved the count up to N decays exponentially in log N. Erdos conjectured that the number of powers of 2 less than n for which n - 2^k is prime should be o(log n).

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem primes_form_n_minus_power_of_two :
    Set.Infinite {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ n k : ℕ, p = n - 2^k} := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely wrong mathematical content (CRITICAL)

The source asks: are there infinitely many **n** such that **for all** k with 1 < 2^k < n, the value n - 2^k is prime? This is a very restrictive condition — n must yield primes when ANY valid power of 2 is subtracted.

The formalization instead asks: are there infinitely many **primes p** such that **there exist some** n, k with p = n - 2^k? This is trivially true — for any prime p, take n = p + 2 and k = 1, giving p = (p+2) - 2^1. So the set in the formalization contains ALL primes, and `Set.Infinite` is trivially provable.

The quantifier structure is fundamentally inverted: the source uses a universal quantifier over k (for ALL valid powers of 2), while the formalization uses an existential (for SOME n, k).

### 2. Wrong subject of quantification (CRITICAL)

The source quantifies over n (which n have the property?), while the formalization quantifies over primes p. The mathematical objects being counted are different.

### 3. Missing answer(sorry) for open problem (MODERATE)

Even if the set definition were correct, asserting `Set.Infinite` as a fact for an open problem is wrong. It should use `answer(sorry) ↔ Set.Infinite {...}`.

### 4. Missing the constraint 1 < 2^k (MODERATE)

The source requires 1 < 2^k < n (so k >= 1, excluding 2^0 = 1). The formalization has no such constraint.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem primes_form_n_minus_power_of_two :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      Set.Infinite {n : ℕ | ∀ k : ℕ, 1 < 2^k → 2^k < n →
        (n - 2^k).Prime} := by
  sorry
```

The key fixes are: (1) quantify over n, not primes; (2) use universal quantifier over k; (3) include the constraint 1 < 2^k; (4) wrap with `answer(sorry)`.

## Confidence: **5%**

The formalization captures a completely different (and trivial) mathematical statement. The source requires n - 2^k to be prime for ALL powers of 2 less than n, while the formalization asks for primes expressible as n - 2^k for SOME n, k. The set in the formalization is essentially the set of all primes, making the statement trivially true. This is not a valid formalization of the source problem.
