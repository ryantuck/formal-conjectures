# Erdős Problem 951 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $a_1<\cdots$ be a sequence of real numbers such that $|\prod a_i^{k_i}-\prod a_j^{\ell_j}| \geq 1$. Is it true that $\#\{ a_i \leq x\} \leq \pi(x)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/951.lean`.

The condition `Erdos951_prop` correctly captures the separation of generalized integers (Beurling integers).
The theorem `erdos_951` asks if the counting function of the sequence is bounded by the prime-counting function.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
