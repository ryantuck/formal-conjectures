# Review of Erdos Problem 577

## Problem Statement
If $G$ is a graph on $4k$ vertices with minimum degree at least $2k$, then $G$ contains $k$ vertex-disjoint 4-cycles.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the existence of a set of disjoint 4-cycles.

```lean
theorem vertex_disjoint_four_cycles (k : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph α) [DecidableRel G.Adj]
    (hcard : Fintype.card α = 4 * k)
    (hmin : ∀ v, G.degree v ≥ 2 * k) :
    ∃ (cycles : Finset (Finset α)),
      cycles.card = k ∧
      (∀ C ∈ cycles, C.card = 4 ∧ ∃ (w : G.Walk ...), w.IsPath ∧ w.length = 4) ∧
      (∀ C₁ C₂, ... Disjoint C₁ C₂) ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is detailed and correct.
- $|V| = 4k$.
- $\delta(G) \ge 2k$.
- Conclusion: $k$ disjoint cycles of length 4.
- The definition of a 4-cycle is explicit (`w.length = 4`).
