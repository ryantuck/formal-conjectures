# Erdős Problem 1069 Review

## Problem Statement

Given any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the number of $k$-rich lines (lines which contain $\geq k$ of the points) is, provided $k\leq n^{1/2}$, $\ll \frac{n^2}{k^3}$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1069.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It sets up the parameters $n, k$ and a set $S$ of size $n$, but does not define $k$-rich lines or the bound.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
