# Review: Erdos Problem 1133

**Problem:** Existence of polynomials with large bounds given interpolation constraints
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1133](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1133)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

For any constant C > 0, there exists epsilon > 0 such that for sufficiently large n: given any points x_1, ..., x_n in [-1,1], one can find y_1, ..., y_n in [-1,1] such that any polynomial P of degree m < (1+epsilon)n satisfying P(x_i) = y_i for at least (1-epsilon)n indices must have max_{x in [-1,1]} |P(x)| > C.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 41]
theorem polynomial_large_bounds (C : ℝ) (hC : 0 < C) :
    ∃ (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ∧
      ∀ᶠ n in atTop, ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ),
        (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        ∃ (y : Fin n → ℝ),
          (∀ i, y i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) ∧
          (∃ P : Polynomial ℝ, P.natDegree ≤ n ∧
            ∀ i, P.eval (y i) ≥ C * n ^ ε) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely wrong statement structure (CRITICAL)

The source says: for any choice of y values, **every** polynomial P of degree < (1+epsilon)n that approximately interpolates must have large max norm. The formalization says: there **exist** y values and there **exists** a polynomial P with certain properties. This reverses the key quantifier on P from universal to existential.

### 2. Wrong conclusion (CRITICAL)

The source conclusion is: max_{x in [-1,1]} |P(x)| > C. This is about the **supremum norm** of P on [-1,1] exceeding C. The formalization instead says: P.eval (y i) >= C * n^epsilon, which is about the polynomial's values at the y-points exceeding C * n^epsilon. These are completely different statements.

### 3. Missing interpolation constraint (CRITICAL)

The core of the problem is about polynomials that **interpolate**: P(x_i) = y_i for at least (1-epsilon)n of the indices. The formalization has no such interpolation condition. Instead, it just asks for a polynomial whose values at y-points are large, which has nothing to do with interpolation.

### 4. Wrong degree bound (MODERATE)

The source requires degree m < (1+epsilon)n, while the formalization uses natDegree <= n. The degree should be related to (1+epsilon)n, not just n.

### 5. Missing "for all P" quantifier (CRITICAL)

The statement should say: for ALL polynomials P satisfying the interpolation and degree constraints, the max norm exceeds C. Instead, it says there EXISTS a polynomial P with certain properties.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem polynomial_large_bounds (C : ℝ) (hC : 0 < C) :
    ∃ (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ∧
      ∀ᶠ n in atTop, ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ),
        (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        ∃ (y : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, y i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) ∧
          ∀ (P : Polynomial ℝ), P.natDegree < ⌈(1 + ε) * n⌉₊ →
            (↑{i : Fin n | P.eval (x i) = y i}.toFinset.card : ℝ) ≥ (1 - ε) * n →
            ⨆ t ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, |P.eval t| > C := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **5%**

The formalization has the correct outer structure (for all C > 0, exists epsilon, eventually for large n, for all nodes x, exist targets y), but the inner mathematical content is completely wrong. The interpolation condition is missing, the universal quantifier on polynomials is replaced by an existential, and the conclusion concerns wrong quantities. The statement as written has essentially no relationship to the source problem's mathematical content.
