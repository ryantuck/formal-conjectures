# Review of Erdos Problem 557

## Problem Statement
Let $R_k(G)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $k$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. Is it true that
$$R_k(T)\leq kn+O(1)$$
for any tree $T$ on $n$ vertices?

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `tree_ramsey_linear` with an existence quantifier but concludes with `sorry`.

```lean
theorem tree_ramsey_linear (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) :
    ∃ C : ℕ, sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R_k(T)$ is not defined.
- The condition "for any tree T on n vertices" is not expressed.
- The inequality involving $kn + O(1)$ (presumably meaning there exists a constant $C$ such that $R_k(T) \le kn + C$) is not expressed.
