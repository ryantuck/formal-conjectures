# Erdős Problem 1086 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $g(n)$ be minimal such that any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contains the vertices of at most $g(n)$ many triangles with the same area. Estimate $g(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1086.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the function $g(n)$ or the triangle area condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
