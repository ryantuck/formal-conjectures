# Erdős Problem 55 Review

## Problem Statement

Best possible bound for Ramsey complete sets is $O(r(\log N)^2)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/55.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_55` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this tight bound. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
