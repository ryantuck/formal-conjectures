# Erdős Problem 1049 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $t>1$ be a rational number. Is $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{t^n-1}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{	au(n)}{t^n}$ irrational?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1049.lean`.

The theorem `series_equality_irrationality` states the identity between the two series (which is a standard Lambert series result) and asks if the sum is irrational.
This captures the essence of the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
