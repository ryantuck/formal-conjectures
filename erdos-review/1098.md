# Erdős Problem 1098 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a group and $\Gamma=\Gamma(G)$ be the non-commuting graph. If $\Gamma$ contains no infinite complete subgraph, then is there a finite bound on the size of complete subgraphs of $\Gamma$?
(Neumann proved this is true if and only if the center has finite index).

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1098.lean` is:
```lean
theorem non_commuting_graph_cliques [Fintype G] :
    (∃ (n : ℕ), ∀ (S : Finset G),
      (∀ x ∈ S, ∀ y ∈ S, x ≠ y → x * y ≠ y * x) →
      S.card ≤ n) ↔
    ∃ (n : ℕ), (Set.center G).ncard * n = Fintype.card G := by
  sorry
```
The formalization includes the typeclass `[Fintype G]`, which assumes $G$ is a finite group. For finite groups, the condition "$\Gamma$ contains no infinite complete subgraph" is vacuously true, and there is always a finite bound on the size of complete subgraphs (the size of the group itself). Similarly, the center of a finite group always has finite index. Thus, the formalized equivalence is effectively `True ↔ True`.
The actual problem concerns infinite groups, asking whether the absence of an *infinite* clique implies a bound on *finite* clique sizes. To formalize this correctly, `[Fintype G]` should be removed, and the finite index condition should be expressed using `Subgroup.index` or equivalent for infinite groups.

## Completeness
The formalization is incomplete/incorrect as it restricts the problem to finite groups, rendering the statement trivial and missing the core mathematical question about infinite groups.
