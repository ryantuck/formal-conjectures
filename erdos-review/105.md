# Erdős Problem 105 Review

## Problem Statement

Does there exist a line intersecting $A$ in $\ge 2$ points and missing $B$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/105.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_105` checks if `answer(False)` corresponds to the existence of a counterexample (sets where no such line exists). Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
