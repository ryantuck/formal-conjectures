# Review of Erdos Problem 605

## Problem Statement
Is there $f(n) \to \infty$ such that $n$ points on sphere have $\ge f(n)n$ pairs at same distance?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts existence of such $f$.

```lean
theorem sphere_same_distance_pairs :
    ∃ (f : ℕ → ℝ), Filter.Tendsto f Filter.atTop Filter.atTop ∧ ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `S` on sphere: `‖p‖ = r`.
- Same distance pairs: `dist p q = 1` (Note: Problem says "same distance", formalization fixes it to 1. On a sphere, if you have many pairs at distance $d$, you can scale/rotate. But usually "same distance" means "there exists some distance $d$". The formalization fixing it to 1 might be a loss of generality if the radius is fixed to something specific that prevents distance 1, but here `r` is existentially quantified `∃ r`. So it says "there exists a sphere of some radius r where many pairs have distance 1". This is equivalent to "there exists a sphere where many pairs have distance d" by scaling).
- Actually, the problem says "points on the surface of a sphere" (singular). Usually implies unit sphere or arbitrary. The formalization quantifies `∃ r`, so it finds *some* sphere.
- `dist p q = 1` checks for unit distance. Is "same distance" equivalent to "unit distance" (up to scaling)? Yes.
