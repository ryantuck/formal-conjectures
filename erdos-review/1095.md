## Problem Statement
Let $g(k) > k+1$ be the smallest $n$ such that all prime factors of $\binom{n}{k}$ are $> k$. Estimate $g(k)$.

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1095.lean` defines `g` as:
```lean
noncomputable def g (k : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sSup {m | ∀ n ∈ Set.Ioc k m, ∃ p ≤ k, p.Prime ∧ p ∣ choose n k}
```
This definition makes `g k` the largest integer $m$ such that for all $k < n \le m$, $\binom{n}{k}$ has a prime factor $\le k$.
The problem statement defines $g(k)$ as the *smallest* $n$ such that *all* prime factors of $\binom{n}{k}$ are $> k$.
Thus, $g_{	ext{code}}(k) = g_{	ext{problem}}(k) - 1$.
Since $g(k)$ grows exponentially with $k$, this difference of 1 is negligible for the asymptotic estimates formalized in the theorems.

The theorems capture the bounds and conjectures mentioned in the problem description (Konyagin's lower bound, Ecklund-Erdős-Selfridge upper conjecture, etc.).

## Completeness
The formalization is complete. The definition of `g` differs by 1 from the text, but this does not affect the validity of the asymptotic statements.

## Confidence
