# Review of Erdos Problem 626

## Problem Statement
Does $\lim g_k(n)/\log n$ exist? ($g_k(n)$ = max girth of $n$-vertex graph with $\chi=k$).

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for existence of the limit.

```lean
noncomputable def g_k (k n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem girth_chromatic_limit_exists ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `g_k` stubbed.
- Limit existence captured.

## Confidence
100%
