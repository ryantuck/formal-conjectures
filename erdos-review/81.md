# Erdős Problem 81 Review

## Problem Statement

Can edges of a chordal graph be partitioned into $n^2/6 + O(n)$ cliques?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/81.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_81` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this partition bound. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
