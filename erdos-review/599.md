# Review of Erdos Problem 599

## Problem Statement
(Erdős-Menger conjecture) Let $G$ be a graph with disjoint independent sets $A$ and $B$. Must there exist a family $P$ of disjoint $A-B$ paths and a set $S$ containing exactly one vertex from each path in $P$ such that $S$ intersects every $A-B$ path?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization sets up the structure but misses the condition that $S$ intersects every path.

```lean
theorem erdos_menger_conjecture ...
    ∃ (P : Set (Σ a b, G.Walk a b)) (S : Set α),
      sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is incomplete (`sorry` in the existential condition). The crucial properties of $P$ and $S$ (disjointness, separation, one-vertex-per-path) are not expressed.
