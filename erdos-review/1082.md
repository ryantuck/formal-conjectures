# Erdős Problem 1082 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points with no three on a line. Does $A$ determine at least $\lfloor n/2floor$ distinct distances?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1082.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It fails to capture the "no three on a line" condition and the bound on distinct distances.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
