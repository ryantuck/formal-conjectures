# Review of Erdos Problem 604

## Problem Statement
Pinned distance problem: Does there exist $x$ such that distinct distances from $x$ are $\gg n^{1-o(1)}$ or even $\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization expresses the two conjectures.

```lean
theorem pinned_distance_problem ... ∃ x ∈ A, (A.image (fun y => dist x y)).card ≥ Nat.floor (c * (n : ℝ) ^ (1 - ε))
theorem pinned_distance_strong_conjecture ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is accurate.
- Distinct distances: `(A.image ...).card`.
- Bounds are correctly transcribed.

## Confidence
100%
