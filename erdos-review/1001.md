# Erdős Problem 1001 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $S(N,A,c)$ be the measure of the set of those $\alpha\in (0,1)$ such that $\left\lvert \alpha-\frac{x}{y}ightvert< \frac{A}{y^2}$ for some $N\leq y\leq cN$ and $(x,y)=1$. Does $\lim_{N	o \infty}S(N,A,c)=f(A,c)$ exist?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1001.lean`.

The definition of `S` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
