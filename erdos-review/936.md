# Erdős Problem 936 Review

## Problem Statement

Are $2^n\pm 1$ and $n!\pm 1$ powerful for only finitely many $n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/936.lean`.

The predicate `EventuallyNotPowerful` correctly formalizes "powerful for only finitely many n".
The theorems cover the four cases ($2^n \pm 1, n! \pm 1$).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.
