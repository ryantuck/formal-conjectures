# Erdős Problem 74 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a graph with infinite chromatic number where every $n$-vertex subgraph can be made bipartite by deleting $f(n)$ edges?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/74.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_74` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this property for any $f \to \infty$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
