# Erdős Problem 31 Review

## Problem Statement

Given any infinite set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, there is a set $B$ of density $0$ such that $A+B$ contains all except finitely many integers.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/31.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_31` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this statement. Matches.
