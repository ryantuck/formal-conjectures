# Erdős Problem 924 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a graph $G$ which contains no $K_{l+1}$ such that every $k$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_l$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/924.lean`.

The theorem `coloring_monochromatic_cliques` asserts the existence of $n$ (size of $G$) such that *any* coloring of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic $K_l$. This is just Ramsey's theorem.
It fails to require that $G$ itself is $K_{l+1}$-free (Folkman graph property).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
