# Erdős Problem 1003 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many solutions to $\phi(n)=\phi(n+1)$, where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1003.lean`.

The main conjecture `erdos_1003` correctly asks if the set $\{n | \phi(n) = \phi(n+1)\}$ is infinite.
The file also includes variants and bounds from literature.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
