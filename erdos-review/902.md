# Erdős Problem 902 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that there is a tournament on $f(n)$ vertices such that every set of $n$ vertices is dominated by at least one other vertex. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/902.lean`.

Definitions for `IsTournament` and `Dominates` are correct.
`f(n)` is correctly defined as the infimum of sizes of tournaments satisfying the property.
Theorems formalize known bounds and the main estimation question.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
