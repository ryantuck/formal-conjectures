# Erdős Problem 2 Review

## Problem Statement

For any $C > 0$, does there exist a covering system of congruences with distinct moduli $n_1 < n_2 < \dots < n_k$ such that $n_1 > C$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/2.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_2` equates `answer(False)` to the statement that for all $C$, such a system exists. This implies the conjecture is that such systems do *not* exist for arbitrarily large minimum modulus (which is the correct resolution by Hough). The formalization of the covering system existence property appears correct using `StrictCoveringSystem`.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
