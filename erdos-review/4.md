# Erdős Problem 4 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for any $C > 0$, there infinitely many $n$ such that:
$$ p_{n + 1} - p_n > C \frac{\log\log n\log\log\log\log n}{(\log\log\log n) ^ 2}\log n $$

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/4.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_4` equates `answer(True)` to the condition that for all $C > 0$, the set of such $n$ is infinite. The bound is explicitly written out in `Erdos4For`. The formalization matches the text.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
