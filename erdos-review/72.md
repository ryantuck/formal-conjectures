# Erdős Problem 72 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a set $A$ of density 0 and $c>0$ such that graphs with average degree $\ge c$ contain a cycle of length in $A$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/72.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_72` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a set. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
