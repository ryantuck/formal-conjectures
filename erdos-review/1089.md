# Erdős Problem 1089 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $g_d(n)$ be minimal such that every collection of $g_d(n)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ determines at least $n$ many distinct distances. Estimate $g_d(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1089.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the function $g_d(n)$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
