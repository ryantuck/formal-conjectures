# Erdős Problem 1008 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every graph with $m$ edges contain a subgraph with $\gg m^{2/3}$ edges which contains no $C_4$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1008.lean`.

The formalization uses `H.CliqueFree 4` to represent "contains no $C_4$".
`CliqueFree 4` means the graph does not contain a $K_4$ (complete graph on 4 vertices).
A $C_4$ is a cycle of length 4. $K_4$ contains $C_4$, but excluding $K_4$ does not exclude $C_4$.
The condition should be "contains no cycle of length 4".

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
