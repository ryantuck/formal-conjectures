# Erdős Problem 48 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many integers $n, m$ such that $\phi(n) = \sigma(m)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/48.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_48` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this set being infinite. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
