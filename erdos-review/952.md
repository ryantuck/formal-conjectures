# Erdős Problem 952 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an infinite sequence of distinct Gaussian primes $x_1,x_2,\ldots$ such that $\lvert x_{n+1}-x_nvert \ll 1$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/952.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_952` asserts the existence of an injective sequence of Gaussian primes with bounded differences. This is the Gaussian moat problem (or walking to infinity on primes).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
