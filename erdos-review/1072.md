# Erdős Problem 1072 Review

## Problem Statement

For any prime $p$, let $f(p)$ be the least integer such that $f(p)!+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$.
Is it true that there are infinitely many $p$ for which $f(p)=p-1$?
Is it true that $f(p)/p	o 0$ for almost all $p$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1072.lean`.

The function $f(p)$ is correctly defined as the infimum of $n$ satisfying the Wilson-like congruence.
The two conjectures are correctly formalized:
1. `Set.Infinite {p | p.Prime ∧ f p = p - 1}` matches the first question.
2. `erdos_1072b` correctly formalizes the density 1 convergence of $f(p)/p$ to 0.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
