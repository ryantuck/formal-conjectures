# Erdős Problem 42 Review

## Problem Statement

For every maximal Sidon set $A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$, is there another Sidon set $B$ of size $M$ such that difference sets are disjoint?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/42.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_42` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
