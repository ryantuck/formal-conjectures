# Erdős Problem 995 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $n_k$ be a lacunary sequence and $f\in L^2([0,1])$. Is it true that $\sum_{1\leq k\leq N}f(\{ \alpha n_k\})=o(N\sqrt{\log\log N})$ for almost all $\alpha$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/995.lean`.

The theorem `lacunary_sum_growth` correctly captures the lacunary condition, the $L^2$ condition (integrable square), and the asymptotic bound.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
