# Review of Erdos Problem 576

## Problem Statement
Determine the behavior of $\mathrm{ex}(n; Q_k)$. Erdős conjectured $\mathrm{ex}(n; Q_3) \sim n^{8/5}$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of an asymptotic upper bound function for general $k$, and the specific conjecture for $Q_3$.

```lean
theorem hypercube_three_conjecture (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧
      (fun (n : ℕ) => (extremalNumber n (hypercubeGraph 3) : ℝ)) ~[Filter.atTop]
        (fun n => c * (n : ℝ) ^ (8 / 5)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The $Q_3$ conjecture is formalized correctly ($\sim n^{8/5}$).
The general behavior part is a bit vague in the Lean file (`∃ f ... ≤ f n`), which is just saying "an upper bound exists", which is always true. It doesn't capture the "Determine the behavior" aspect fully (which usually implies finding tight bounds), but for a formal statement, unless one has a specific conjecture, this is a placeholder.
