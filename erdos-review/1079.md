# Erdős Problem 1079 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $r\geq 4$. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\mathrm{ex}(n;K_r)$ edges then must $G$ contain a vertex with degree $d\gg_r n$ whose neighbourhood contains at least $\mathrm{ex}(d;K_{r-1})$ edges?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1079.lean`.

The formalization in the file `degree_neighborhood_condition` states:
`∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) ..., (∀ v w : Fin n, G.degree v = G.degree w) → ∃ (k : ℕ), ∀ v : Fin n, G.degree v = k`
This statement merely asserts that a regular graph has a constant degree, which is a triviality and completely unrelated to the Erdős problem 1079.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect and does not represent the problem at all.
