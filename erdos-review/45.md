# Erdős Problem 45 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an $n_k$ such that divisors of $n_k$ allow a monochromatic solution to $\sum 1/d = 1$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/45.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_45` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to this existence. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
