# Erdős Problem 102 Review

## Problem Statement

If there are $\ge cn^2$ lines with $>3$ points, must there be a line with $h_c(n)$ points, where $h_c(n) \to \infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/102.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_102` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this limit property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
