# Erdős Problem 991 Review

## Problem Statement

Suppose $A=\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}\subset S^2$ maximises $\prod_{i<j}\lvert w_i-w_jvert$. Is it true that the discrepancy is $o(n)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/991.lean`.

The theorem `sphere_max_product_discrepancy` correctly defines the maximization condition and the discrepancy bound.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
