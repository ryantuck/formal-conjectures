# Erdős Problem 976 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial. Let $F_f(n)$ be the greatest prime divisor of $\prod_{1\leq m\leq n}f(m)$. Estimate $F_f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/976.lean`.

The function `F(f, n)` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
