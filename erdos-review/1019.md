# Erdős Problem 1019 Review

## Problem Statement

A planar graph on $n$ vertices with $3n-6$ edges is called saturated. Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4floor+\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2}floor$ edges contain a saturated planar graph with $>3$ vertices?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1019.lean`.

The predicate `IsPlanar` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The concept of "saturated" is not explicitly defined but implicitly handled by looking for *some* planar subgraph? No, the problem asks if it contains a *saturated* planar graph.
The formalization asks for `H ≤ G ∧ IsPlanar H ∧ (∀ u v : Fin n, ¬H.Adj u v → (∃ K : SimpleGraph (Fin n), K ≤ G ∧ ¬IsPlanar K))`.
This condition looks like "maximally planar within G" or "adding any edge from G destroys planarity"?
A "saturated planar graph" usually means a maximal planar graph on its vertices (triangulation), i.e., adding *any* edge (even one not in G) would destroy planarity.
The formalization seems to define a subgraph $H$ such that adding any edge from $G$ makes it non-planar? That's not "saturated planar graph" in the standard sense (which is intrinsic to H).
The standard definition (and the problem text "with 3n-6 edges") implies H must have $3|V(H)| - 6$ edges.
The formalization fails to enforce the $3n-6$ edge count or the standard saturation property.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete and likely incorrect.
