# Erdős Problem 1056 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 2$. Does there exist a prime $p$ and consecutive intervals $I_1,\ldots,I_k$ such that $\prod_{n\in I_i}n \equiv 1\pmod{p}$ for all $1\leq i\leq k$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1056.lean`.

The predicate `AllModProdEqualsOne` and theorem `erdos_1056` correctly capture the existence of such intervals and prime $p$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
