# Erdős Problem 1083 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $d\geq 3$, and let $f_d(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ determines at least $m$ distinct distances. Estimate $f_d(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1083.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the function $f_d(n)$ or the estimation goal.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
