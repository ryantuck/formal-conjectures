# Review of Erdos Problem 657

## Problem Statement
No isosceles triangles $\implies f(n)n$ distinct distances, $f(n) \to \infty$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for existence of such $f$.

```lean
theorem no_isosceles_many_distances ...
      (NoIsoscelesTriangles A) →
      sorry ≥ Nat.floor (f n * n)
```

## Critique
The formalization uses `sorry` for distinct distances count.
- `NoIsoscelesTriangles` is defined (stub).
- Structure correct.

## Confidence
90% (Stub count)
