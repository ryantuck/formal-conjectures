# Erdős Problem 27 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a constant $C > 1$ allowing $\epsilon$-almost covering systems with moduli in $[N, CN]$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/27.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_27` checks if `answer(False)` corresponds to the existence of such covering systems.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
