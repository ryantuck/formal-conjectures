# Review: Erdos Problem 1130

**Problem:** Lebesgue constants for Lagrange interpolation
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1130](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1130)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Given points x_1, ..., x_n in [-1,1], define the Lagrange fundamental functions l_k(x) = prod_{i != k} (x - x_i) / prod_{i != k} (x_k - x_i). With x_0 = -1 and x_{n+1} = 1, define:

  Upsilon(x_1,...,x_n) = min_{0 <= i <= n} max_{x in [x_i, x_{i+1}]} sum_k |l_k(x)|

Is Upsilon(x_1,...,x_n) << log n? Which choice of {x_i} maximizes this quantity?

De Boor and Pinkus proved Upsilon(x_1,...,x_n) <= (2/pi) log n + O(1).

## Current Formalization

```lean
/-- Lebesgue constant for Lagrange interpolation -/
noncomputable def Λ {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry

/-- Lebesgue constant bounds -/
@[category research solved, AMS 41]
theorem lebesgue_constant_bounds (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ (c : ℝ), 0 < c ∧
      ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        Λ x ≥ (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n - c := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Wrong quantity formalized (CRITICAL)

The source problem defines a special quantity Upsilon which is the *minimum over subintervals* of the *maximum of the Lebesgue function on each subinterval*. This is not the standard Lebesgue constant Lambda_n = max_{x in [-1,1]} sum_k |l_k(x)|. The formalization uses a generic `Λ` defined as `sorry`, so we cannot verify what it computes, but the docstring says "Lebesgue constant" which is the standard max-norm quantity, not the Upsilon quantity from the problem.

### 2. Wrong direction of the inequality (CRITICAL)

The source problem asks whether Upsilon << log n, i.e., an **upper bound** of O(log n). The solution by De Boor and Pinkus shows Upsilon <= (2/pi) log n + O(1). However, the formalization states a **lower bound**: `Λ x >= (2/pi) * log n - c`. This is the reverse direction. While lower bounds for the standard Lebesgue constant are known (and related to Problem 1129), the specific question here is about the upper bound for Upsilon.

### 3. Quantifier structure partially correct (MODERATE)

The formalization correctly quantifies over all choices of nodes x in [-1,1]. However, it claims the bound holds for all x, which is a lower bound statement. The source problem asks about maximizing Upsilon and bounding it from above, which is a different claim.

### 4. Missing structural definition of Upsilon (CRITICAL)

The quantity Upsilon involves: (a) augmenting the node set with endpoints -1 and 1, (b) taking subintervals [x_i, x_{i+1}], (c) computing max of the Lebesgue function on each subinterval, and (d) taking the minimum over subintervals. None of this structure is captured.

### 5. Status correctly marked as solved (MINOR positive)

The file correctly identifies this as PROVED/solved.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- Lagrange basis polynomial for node k -/
noncomputable def lagrangeBasis {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) (k : Fin n) : Polynomial ℝ := sorry

/-- Lebesgue function (sum of absolute values of Lagrange basis) -/
noncomputable def lebesgueFunction {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ k, |Polynomial.eval t (lagrangeBasis x k)|

/-- Upsilon: min over subintervals of max of Lebesgue function -/
noncomputable def Upsilon {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry
-- min over intervals [x_i, x_{i+1}] (with x_0 = -1, x_{n+1} = 1) of
-- max_{t in interval} lebesgueFunction x t

/-- De Boor-Pinkus: Upsilon(x_1,...,x_n) <= (2/pi) log n + O(1) -/
theorem upsilon_upper_bound :
    ∃ (c : ℝ), ∀ᶠ n in atTop,
      ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        Upsilon x ≤ (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n + c := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **15%**

The formalization captures the general theme of Lebesgue constants for Lagrange interpolation on [-1,1] and uses the correct constant 2/pi. However, the wrong quantity is being bounded (standard Lebesgue constant vs. Upsilon), the inequality direction is reversed (lower bound vs. upper bound), and the structural definition of Upsilon with subintervals is entirely missing. The `sorry` definition of Lambda makes verification impossible.
