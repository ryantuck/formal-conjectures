# Erdős Problem 100 Review

## Problem Statement

If distances in $A$ are separated by at least 1, is diam(A) $\gg n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/100.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_100` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this linear lower bound. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
