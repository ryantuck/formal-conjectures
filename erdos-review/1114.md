# Review: Erdos Problem 1114

**Problem:** Monotonicity of gaps between zeros of derivatives of polynomials with roots in arithmetic progression
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1114](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1114)
**Status:** PROVED (by Balint, 1960)

## Source Problem

Let f(x) be a real polynomial of degree n whose roots a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_n are all real and form an arithmetic progression. Then the differences between consecutive zeros of f'(x), beginning from the midpoint of (a_0, a_n) towards the endpoints, are monotonically increasing.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem polynomial_derivative_zeros (P : Polynomial ℂ) (hP : P ≠ 0) :
    (∀ z : ℂ, P.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1) →
    ∀ z : ℂ, Polynomial.derivative P |>.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1 + (1 : ℝ) / P.natDegree := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely different problem (CRITICAL)

The formalization states a Sendov-type conjecture: if all roots of P lie in the unit disc, then all roots of P' lie in a disc of radius 1 + 1/n. This is NOT the problem described in Problem 1114 at all.

The source problem is about:
- Real polynomials (not complex)
- Roots in arithmetic progression
- The gaps between consecutive zeros of the derivative
- Monotonicity of those gaps from the midpoint outward

The formalization is about:
- Complex polynomials
- Roots in the unit disc (no arithmetic progression condition)
- Bounding the absolute value of derivative zeros
- A radius bound (not monotonicity of gaps)

### 2. Wrong polynomial ring (MODERATE)

The source deals with real polynomials (Polynomial R), but the formalization uses Polynomial C. While every real polynomial embeds into complex polynomials, the source problem is fundamentally about real roots and their ordering on the real line.

### 3. No arithmetic progression condition (CRITICAL)

The source requires roots to form an arithmetic progression. The formalization has no such condition.

### 4. No monotonicity statement (CRITICAL)

The core conclusion -- that gaps between consecutive zeros of f' increase from the midpoint outward -- is entirely absent. Instead, the formalization gives a disc containment bound.

### 5. Wrong theorem entirely (CRITICAL)

This appears to be a formalization of a different problem (perhaps related to Sendov's conjecture or the Gauss-Lucas theorem variant) rather than Erdos Problem 1114.

### 6. The bound 1 + 1/n is suspicious (MINOR)

Even for the problem it seems to be trying to formalize, the bound ||z|| <= 1 + 1/deg(P) is not a standard result. The Gauss-Lucas theorem says roots of P' lie in the convex hull of roots of P, giving ||z|| <= 1 directly. The bound 1 + 1/n appears to be fabricated.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- If f is a real polynomial of degree n+1 whose n+1 real roots form an arithmetic
    progression, then the gaps between consecutive zeros of f', measured from the
    center outward, are monotonically increasing. -/
theorem polynomial_derivative_zeros_monotone_gaps
    (P : Polynomial ℝ) (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n)
    (roots : Fin (n + 2) → ℝ) (hroots_sorted : StrictMono roots)
    (hAP : ∃ d : ℝ, 0 < d ∧ ∀ i : Fin (n + 1),
      roots i.succ - roots i.castSucc = d)
    (hP_roots : ∀ i, P.IsRoot (roots i))
    (hP_deg : P.natDegree = n + 1)
    (dz : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ) (hdz_sorted : StrictMono dz)
    (hdz_roots : ∀ i, (Polynomial.derivative P).IsRoot (dz i)) :
    -- gaps from center outward are monotonically increasing
    sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization is a completely different theorem from the source problem. It formalizes something resembling a Sendov/Gauss-Lucas variant instead of the actual problem about arithmetic progressions and monotone derivative gaps. No aspect of the source problem is captured.
