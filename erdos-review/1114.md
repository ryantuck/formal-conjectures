# Review: Erdos Problem 1114

**Problem:** Monotonicity of gaps between zeros of derivatives of polynomials with roots in arithmetic progression
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1114](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1114)
**Status:** PROVED (by Balint, 1960)

## Source Problem

Let f(x) be a real polynomial of degree n whose roots a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_n are all real and form an arithmetic progression. Then the differences between consecutive zeros of f'(x), beginning from the midpoint of (a_0, a_n) towards the endpoints, are monotonically increasing. (Proved by Balint in 1960.)

## Current Formalization

    (P : Polynomial ℝ) (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n)
    (roots : Fin (n + 2) → ℝ) (hroots_sorted : StrictMono roots)
    (hAP : ∃ d : ℝ, 0 < d ∧ ∀ i : Fin (n + 1),
      roots i.succ - roots i.castSucc = d)
    (hP_roots : ∀ i, P.IsRoot (roots i))
    (hP_deg : P.natDegree = n + 1)
    (dz : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ) (hdz_sorted : StrictMono dz)
    (hdz_roots : ∀ i, (Polynomial.derivative P).IsRoot (dz i)) :

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Good structural match (POSITIVE)

The rewrite is a massive improvement over the previous version, which formalized a completely unrelated Sendov-type problem. The new version correctly:
- Uses real polynomials (`Polynomial ℝ`)
- Requires roots to form a strict arithmetic progression
- Introduces derivative zeros and their gaps
- Attempts to capture the monotonicity-from-center property

### 2. Monotonicity direction issue (MODERATE)

The source says "the differences between consecutive zeros of f'(x), beginning from the midpoint of (a_0, a_n) towards the endpoints, are monotonically increasing." The formalization captures only one side: for indices i < j <= center, the gap at j is at least the gap at i. This captures increasing gaps as you move from the outermost zeros toward the center, or equivalently, the conclusion states that moving from i to j (where j is closer to center) the gaps grow.

However, the source says gaps increase "from the midpoint towards the endpoints," meaning gaps should increase as you move AWAY from the center. The formalization has the direction: `i < j -> j <= center -> gap(j) >= gap(i)`, which says gaps increase as you move toward the center (from the left). This appears to be the WRONG direction. The source says gaps measured from the midpoint outward are increasing, i.e., the gap closest to the center is smallest and grows as you move toward the endpoints.

A correct formalization would need: for i < j where center <= i, gap(j) >= gap(i) (gaps increase moving rightward from center), AND for i < j where j <= center, gap(i) >= gap(j) (gaps increase moving leftward from center). The current statement only captures one half and appears to have the inequality reversed.

### 3. Only captures one half of the symmetry (MODERATE)

The problem is about monotonicity on BOTH sides from the midpoint. The formalization only quantifies over indices up to `center`, missing the right half (indices above center). A complete formalization would need to state monotonicity on both sides of the center.

### 4. Degree and root count (MINOR)

The polynomial has degree `n + 1` and `n + 2` roots (indexed by `Fin (n + 2)`). By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree n + 1 has at most n + 1 roots. Having n + 2 roots would force P = 0 (unless roots are counted with multiplicity, but `StrictMono roots` ensures distinct roots). With `n + 2` distinct roots and degree `n + 1`, this is only possible if `n + 2 <= n + 1 + 1 = n + 2`, i.e., the polynomial has exactly degree n + 1 and splits completely. This is actually correct: a degree n + 1 polynomial has n + 2 coefficients but at most n + 1 roots, wait -- no. A degree (n+1) polynomial has at most (n+1) roots. But Fin (n+2) gives n+2 values. So n+2 distinct roots for a degree n+1 polynomial is impossible unless n+2 <= n+1, i.e., never. This means the hypotheses are contradictory when n >= 0, making the theorem vacuously true.

Actually, let me recount: `hP_deg : P.natDegree = n + 1` and `roots : Fin (n + 2) → ℝ` with `hroots_sorted : StrictMono roots` gives n + 2 distinct roots. A polynomial of degree n + 1 can have at most n + 1 distinct roots. So we need n + 2 <= n + 1, which is impossible. **The hypotheses are inconsistent, making the theorem vacuously true.**

This is a CRITICAL bug. The root count should be `Fin (n + 1)` (giving n + 1 roots for a degree n polynomial, which makes the derivative have degree n - 1 and at most n roots... but then we'd also need the derivative zeros count to match). Let me think more carefully:

If the polynomial has degree d, it has at most d roots. Its derivative has degree d - 1, and by Rolle's theorem, it has exactly d - 1 roots (one between each consecutive pair of roots of the original polynomial). So if we set degree = n + 1 and have n + 2 roots... that's too many. The correct setup would be: degree n + 1, with n + 2 roots is inconsistent. We need: degree n + 1 with n + 1 roots (Fin (n+1)), and the derivative has n roots (Fin n). But then the "gaps" between consecutive derivative zeros would be indexed by Fin (n - 1), and the hypothesis `1 <= n` ensures at least one gap.

### 5. Derivative zero count not constrained to be complete (MINOR)

The formalization provides `dz : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ` as derivative zeros but does not require these are ALL the derivative zeros. By Rolle's theorem, P' has exactly n derivative zeros (one between each pair of consecutive roots). The formalization uses Fin (n + 1) for derivative zeros, which would be n + 1 zeros for a degree n + 1 polynomial whose derivative has degree n -- this count would be correct if all roots are real and simple. But given the root count issue above, this is moot.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem polynomial_derivative_zeros_monotone_gaps
    (P : Polynomial ℝ) (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n)
    (roots : Fin (n + 1) → ℝ) (hroots_sorted : StrictMono roots)
    (hAP : ∃ d : ℝ, 0 < d ∧ ∀ i : Fin n,
      roots i.succ - roots i.castSucc = d)
    (hP_roots : ∀ i, P.IsRoot (roots i))
    (hP_deg : P.natDegree = n)
    (dz : Fin n → ℝ) (hdz_sorted : StrictMono dz)
    (hdz_roots : ∀ i, (Polynomial.derivative P).IsRoot (dz i)) :
    -- Gaps between consecutive derivative zeros increase from center outward
    -- (on both sides of the midpoint)
    ∀ i j : Fin (n - 1),
      -- Both on same side of center, j farther from center than i
      sorry := by
  sorry
```

The key fix is: degree n polynomial with n + 1 roots (Fin (n+1)), derivative with n zeros (Fin n), and n - 1 gaps. The monotonicity condition needs to express: measuring from the center outward in both directions, the gaps are increasing.

## Confidence: **10%**

The rewrite addresses the correct problem (unlike the original which was a completely wrong theorem), and it correctly identifies the key ingredients: real polynomial, arithmetic progression of roots, derivative zeros, and gap monotonicity from the center. However, a critical bug makes the hypotheses contradictory (n + 2 distinct roots for a degree n + 1 polynomial), rendering the theorem vacuously true. Additionally, the monotonicity direction appears inverted, and only one side from the center is covered. The mathematical intent is recognizable, but the statement is not a valid formalization.
