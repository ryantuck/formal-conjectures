# Erdős Problem 1092 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $f_r(n)$ be maximal such that, if a graph $G$ has the property that every subgraph $H$ on $m$ vertices is the union of a graph with chromatic number $r$ and a graph with $\leq f_r(m)$ edges, then $G$ has chromatic number $\leq r+1$.

Is it true that $f_2(n) \gg n$? More generally, is $f_r(n)\gg_r n$?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1092.lean` defines `f` as:
```lean
noncomputable def f (r n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sSup {k : ℕ |
    ∀ G : SimpleGraph (Fin n),
      (∀ H : Subgraph G,
        ∃ E : Finset (Sym2 H.verts),
          E.card ≤ k ∧
          chromaticNumber (H.coe.deleteEdges E) ≤ (r + 1 : ℕ∞)) →
      chromaticNumber G ≤ (r + 1 : ℕ∞)}
```
There are discrepancies between this definition and the problem statement:
1.  **Chromatic Number Mismatch:** The problem statement has the condition that subgraphs are the union of a graph with chromatic number $r$ and a few edges, implying the result that $G$ has chromatic number $\leq r+1$. The code uses `r+1` in the condition (`chromaticNumber ... ≤ r + 1`) and `r+1` in the conclusion.
2.  **Function Parameter:** The problem statement implies $f_r(m)$ depends on the size $m$ of the subgraph $H$. The code uses a single value `k` (which corresponds to $f(r, n)$) for all subgraphs $H$ of $G$, regardless of their size.

The conjectures are stated as:
```lean
theorem f_asymptotic_2 : answer(sorry) ↔
    (fun (n : ℕ) => (n : ℝ)) =o[atTop] (fun (n : ℕ) => (f 2 n : ℝ))

theorem f_asymptotic_general :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ r : ℕ, (fun n : ℕ => ((r : ℝ) * n)) =o[atTop] (fun n : ℕ => (f r n : ℝ))
```
These capture the asymptotic lower bound questions, but the definition of `f` they rely on seems incorrect.

## Completeness
The formalization seems to define a different function than described in the problem statement due to the chromatic number index and the handling of subgraph sizes.
