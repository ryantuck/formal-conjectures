# Review of Erdos Problem 644

## Problem Statement
Estimate $f(k,r)$ for families of k-sets where every r sets have a common intersecting pair.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for bounds.

```lean
noncomputable def f (k r : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem set_family_intersection_property ... c₁ * sorry ≤ f k r ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton. The intersection property is not in the code.

## Confidence
50% (Skeleton)
