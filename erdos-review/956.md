# Erdős Problem 956 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $h(n)$ be the maximal number of unit distances between disjoint convex translates. Prove that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $h(n)>n^{1+c}$ for all large $n$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/956.lean`.

The theorem `unit_distance_translates` correctly asks for the existence of $c$ such that for any $n$, there exists a configuration with $\ge c n^{1+c}$ unit distances. (Note: the order of quantifiers `∀ n, ∃ ... c*n^(1+c)` implies $n^{1+c}$ bound for each n, which matches the asymptotic lower bound requirement).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
