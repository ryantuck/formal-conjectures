# Erdős Problem 913 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many $n$ such that if $n(n+1) = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$ is the factorisation into distinct primes then all exponents $k_i$ are distinct?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/913.lean`.

The condition "all exponents distinct" is formalized as `Set.InjOn (n * (n + 1)).factorization (n * (n + 1)).primeFactors`. This checks injectivity of the exponent map on the set of prime factors.
The theorem asks if the set of such $n$ is infinite.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
