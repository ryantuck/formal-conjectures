# Erdős Problem 917 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 4$ and $f_k(n)$ be the largest number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices which has chromatic number $k$ and is critical. Is it true that $f_k(n) \gg_k n^2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/917.lean`.

The definition of edge-criticality (`deleteEdges ... chromaticNumber < k`) is correct.
The theorem `critical_graph_edges` correctly asks if the number of edges is bounded below by $c n^2$ for some $c>0$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
