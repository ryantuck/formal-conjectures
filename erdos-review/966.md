# Erdős Problem 966 Review

## Problem Statement

Does there exist a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ that contains no non-trivial arithmetic progression of length $k+1$, yet in any $r$-colouring of $A$ there must exist a monochromatic non-trivial arithmetic progression of length $k$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/966.lean`.

The theorem `ap_free_ramsey` correctly constructs the set $A$ with the required properties (no AP of length $k+1$, but Ramsey for AP of length $k$).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
