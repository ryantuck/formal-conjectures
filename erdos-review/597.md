# Review of Erdos Problem 597

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a graph on at most $\aleph_1$ vertices containing no $K_4$ and no $K_{\aleph_0,\aleph_0}$.
Does the partition relation $\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1\omega, G)^2$ hold?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization is a stub that concludes `True`? No, it has `answer ↔ ... → True`.

```lean
theorem partition_relation_omega_one_graph (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Ordinal.{0})),
      (∀ (f : Fin 4 ↪ Ordinal.{0}), ¬ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → G.Adj (f i) (f j)) →
      True := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing the partition relation itself. It just quantifies over $G$ and concludes `True`. The core question $\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1\omega, G)^2$ is not expressed.
