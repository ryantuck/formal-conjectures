# Erdős Problem 59 Review

## Problem Statement

Is the number of $G$-free graphs on $n$ vertices $\le 2^{(1+o(1))\mathrm{ex}(n;G)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/59.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_59` checks if `answer(False)` corresponds to this bound holding for all graphs. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
