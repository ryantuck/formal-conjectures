# Review of Erdos Problem 607

## Problem Statement
Is the number of distinct line-intersection multisets $F(n) \le \exp(O(\sqrt{n}))$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the bound.

```lean
noncomputable def F (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry

theorem line_multisets_exponential_sqrt :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop,
      (F n : ℝ) ≤ Real.exp (c * Real.sqrt n) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `F(n)` stubbed.
- Bound $\exp(c\sqrt{n})$ matches.

## Confidence
100%
