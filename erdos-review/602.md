# Review of Erdos Problem 602

## Problem Statement
Let $(A_i)$ be a family of countably infinite sets such that $|A_i \cap A_j|$ is finite and $\neq 1$ for $i \neq j$. Does there exist a 2-coloring of $\cup A_i$ such that no $A_i$ is monochromatic?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of such a coloring.

```lean
theorem property_b_intersection_not_one (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ (family : ℕ → Set ℕ),
      (∀ i, (family i).Infinite) ∧
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → (family i ∩ family j).Finite ∧ (family i ∩ family j).ncard ≠ 1) →
      ∃ (coloring : ℕ → Fin 2),
        ∀ i, ∃ a b, a ∈ family i ∧ b ∈ family i ∧ coloring a ≠ coloring b := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is precise.
- Countably infinite sets: `(family i).Infinite` (and mapped from `ℕ`).
- Intersection condition: `Finite` and `ncard ≠ 1`.
- Property B (2-coloring): `∃ a b ... coloring a ≠ coloring b`.
