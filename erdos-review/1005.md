# Erdős Problem 1005 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $a_1/b_1, \dots$ be the Farey fractions of order $n$. Let $f(n)$ be the largest integer such that if $1\leq k<l\leq k+f(n)$ then $a_k/b_k$ and $a_l/b_l$ are similarly ordered. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1005.lean`.

The Farey sequence and the function $f(n)$ are correctly defined.
The conjecture `farey_ordering_linear` asks if $f(n) \sim cn$ for some $c>0$, which is a specific interpretation of "Estimate $f(n)$".

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
