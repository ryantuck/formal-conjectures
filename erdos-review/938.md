# Erdős Problem 938 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A=\{n_1<n_2<\cdots\}$ be the sequence of powerful numbers. Are there only finitely many three-term progressions of consecutive terms $n_k,n_{k+1},n_{k+2}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/938.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_938` checks if the set of 3-term AP subsets of the sequence of powerful numbers, which are also consecutive in index (`nth Powerful k`, `k+1`, `k+2`), is finite.
This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
