# Erdős Problem 1070 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that, given any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, there exist $f(n)$ points such that no two are distance $1$ apart. Estimate $f(n)$. In particular, is it true that $f(n)\geq n/4$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1070.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the independence number of the unit distance graph or the function $f(n)$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
