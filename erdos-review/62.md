# Erdős Problem 62 Review

## Problem Statement

If $G_1,G_2$ have chromatic number $\aleph_1$, must they share a subgraph with chromatic number $\ge 4$ (or $\aleph_0$)?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/62.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_62` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the intersection property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
