# Erdős Problem 965 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for any $2$-colouring of $\mathbb{R}$, there is a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $\aleph_1$ such that all sums $a+b$ with $a
eq b$ and $a,b\in A$ are the same colour?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/965.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_965` captures the problem. `¬ A.Countable` is used to represent cardinality $\aleph_1$ (uncountable). Given the context of real numbers and set theory problems, this is a standard interpretation unless CH is assumed false and specific alephs are distinguished.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
