# Review of Erdos Problem 633

## Problem Statement
Classify triangles that can only be cut into a square number of congruent triangles.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for a set $S$ characterizing this property.

```lean
theorem triangle_square_dissection :
    ∃ S : Set (Set (Fin 2 → ℝ)),
      ∀ T : Set (Fin 2 → ℝ), (∀ n : ℕ, CanBeCutInto T n → ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2) ↔ T ∈ S := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the classification problem structure.

## Confidence
100%
