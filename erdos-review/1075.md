# Erdős Problem 1075 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $r\geq 3$. There exists $c_r > r^{-r}$ such that, for any $\epsilon > 0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, any $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with at least $(1+\epsilon)(n/r)^r$ many edges contains a subgraph on $m$ vertices with at least $c_rm^r$ edges, where $m=m(n)	o \infty$ as $n	o \infty$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1075.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not specify the edge density condition, the subgraph density condition, or the constants involved.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
