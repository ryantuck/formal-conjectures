## Problem Statement

Is it true that $f(n,k) < c_k^n$ for some constant $c_k>0$ and for all $n > 0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/20.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_20` formalizes the upper bound on the sunflower function $f(n,k)$.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
