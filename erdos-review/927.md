# Erdős Problem 927 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $g(n)$ be the maximum number of different sizes of cliques that can occur in a graph on $n$ vertices. Estimate $g(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/927.lean`.

The formalization `not_clique_sizes_bound` asserts that it is *not* true that the number of clique sizes is bounded by $\sqrt{n}+1$.
The problem asks for an estimate $n - \log n \dots$.
Negating a $\sqrt{n}$ bound does not capture the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
