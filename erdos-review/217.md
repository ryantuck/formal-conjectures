# Erdős Problem 217 Review

## Problem Statement

Points with specific distance multiplicities.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/217.lean`.

The theorems `erdos_217.lb` and `.sufficiently_large` state existence for small $n$ and non-existence for large $n$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proofs, but the statements are complete.

## Confidence

100%
