# Review of Erdos Problem 552

## Problem Statement
Determine $R(C_4, S_n)$ where $S_n$ is the star $K_{1,n}$.
In particular, is it true that for any $c > 0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $R(C_4, S_n) \le n + \sqrt{n} - c$?

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `ramsey_c4_star_bounds` as `True` and `ramsey_c4_star_conjecture` using `answer(sorry) ↔ sorry`.

```lean
theorem ramsey_c4_star_bounds :
    ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 2 → True := by
  intro _ _
  trivial

theorem ramsey_c4_star_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R(C_4, S_n)$ is not defined or mentioned.
- The specific question about the existence of $c > 0$ and infinitely many $n$ satisfying the inequality is not formalized.
