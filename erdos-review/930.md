# Erdős Problem 930 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for every $r$, there is a $k$ such that if $I_1,\ldots,I_r$ are disjoint intervals of consecutive integers, all of length at least $k$, then $\prod_{1\leq i\leq r}\prod_{m\in I_i}m$ is not a perfect power?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/930.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_930` correctly formalizes the problem.
It quantifies over disjoint intervals $I_i$ (using `Icc`) of length at least $k$.
It asserts that the product of elements in these intervals is not a perfect power (`¬ IsPower ...`).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
