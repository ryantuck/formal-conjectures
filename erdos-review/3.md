# Erdős Problem 3 Review

## Problem Statement

If $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ has $\sum_{n \in A}\frac 1 n = \infty$, then must $A$ contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/3.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_3` asks if `answer(sorry)` is equivalent to: for all sets $A$ with divergent reciprocal sum, there exist arithmetic progressions of length $k$ in $A$ for frequently large $k$. This correctly captures "arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions".

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof and the answer, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
