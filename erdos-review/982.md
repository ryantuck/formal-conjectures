# Erdős Problem 982 Review

## Problem Statement

If $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon then some vertex has at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}floor$ different distances to other vertices.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/982.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_982` correctly captures the convex polygon condition and the distinct distance count for a vertex.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
