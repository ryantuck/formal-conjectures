# Erdős Problem 941 Review

## Problem Statement

Are all large integers the sum of at most three powerful numbers?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/941.lean`.

The formalization `powerful_sum_three` asserts that there exists $N$ such that every $n \ge N$ is the sum of three powerful numbers.
Note: "at most three" usually allows sum of 1, 2, or 3. The formalization asks for exactly 3. Since 0 is powerful (or 1 is powerful), usually one can pad. `IsPowerful` definition: `p | n -> p^2 | n`. 0 is powerful? `p | 0` is true, `p^2 | 0` is true. So 0 is powerful. Thus sum of 3 implies sum of at most 3.
Also, 1 is powerful.
So "sum of 3" implies "sum of at most 3" if we can use 0 or 1.
This is accurate enough.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.
