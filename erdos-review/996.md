# Erdős Problem 996 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $n_k$ be a lacunary sequence, $f\in L^2$. If $\| f-f_n\|_2 \ll 1/(\log\log\log n)^{C}$, does the mean converge for almost every $\alpha$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/996.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_996.log3` correctly states the condition on the approximation by partial Fourier sums (`fourierPartial f k`) and the almost everywhere convergence of the average.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
