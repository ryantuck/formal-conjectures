# Review of Erdos Problem 550

## Problem Statement
Let $m_1\leq\cdots\leq m_k$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. If $T$ is a tree on $n$ vertices and $G$ is the complete multipartite graph with vertex class sizes $m_1,\ldots,m_k$ then prove that\[R(T,G)\leq (\chi(G)-1)(R(T,K_{m_1,m_2})-1)+m_1.\]

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub. It defines a theorem `ramsey_tree_multipartite` that takes some arguments but the conclusion is simply `True`.

```lean
theorem ramsey_tree_multipartite :
    ∀ (k : ℕ) (m : Fin k → ℕ), (∀ i j, i ≤ j → m i ≤ m j) →
      True := by
  intro _ _ _
  trivial
```

## Critique
The formalization does not capture the problem statement at all. It is missing:
- Definition of `n` being sufficiently large.
- Definition of `T` as a tree on `n` vertices.
- Definition of `G` as a complete multipartite graph with class sizes `m_i`.
- The Ramsey number `R(T,G)`.
- The inequality involving the chromatic number `χ(G)` and `R(T, K_{m_1, m_2})`.
