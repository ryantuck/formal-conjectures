# Erdős Problem 953 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A\subset \{ x\in \mathbb{R}^2 : \lvert xvert <r\}$ be a measurable set with no integer distances. How large can the measure of $A$ be?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/953.lean`.

The formalization defines the supremum of measures of such sets as `M r`.
It does not pose a conjecture or question about `M r` (e.g., lower bounds, asymptotic behavior).
It merely gives a name to the answer.

## Completeness

The formalization is weak. It formally defines the object of study but not the problem (estimating it).
