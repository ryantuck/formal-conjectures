# Erdős Problem 1059 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p-k!$ is composite for each $k$ such that $1\leq k!<p$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1059.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_1059` asks for the infinitude of primes $p$ where `AllFactorialSubtractionsComposite p` holds.
This predicate `AllFactorialSubtractionsComposite` correctly checks if $p-k!$ is composite for all factorials $< p$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
