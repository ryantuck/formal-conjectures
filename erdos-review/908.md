# Erdős Problem 908 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f:\mathbb{R}	o \mathbb{R}$ be such that $f(x+h)-f(x)$ is measurable for every $h>0$. Is it true that $f=g+h+r$ where $g$ is continuous, $h$ additive, and $r(x+h)-r(x)=0$ almost everywhere?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/908.lean`.

1.  **Hypothesis:** `Measurable f`. This is stronger than "differences are measurable". If $f$ is measurable, the decomposition is trivial or different.
2.  **Conclusion for $r$:** `∃ T : ℝ, T > 0 ∧ ∀ x : ℝ, r (x + T) = r x`. This claims $r$ is periodic. The problem says "$\Delta_h r = 0$ almost everywhere". These are not the same.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
