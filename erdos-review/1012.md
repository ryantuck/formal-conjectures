# Erdős Problem 1012 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 0$. Let $f(k)$ be such that every graph on $n\geq f(k)$ vertices with at least $\binom{n-k-1}{2}+\binom{k+2}{2}+1$ edges contains a cycle on $n-k$ vertices. Determine or estimate $f(k)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1012.lean`.

The function `f` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem `cycle_edge_density` states the property $f(k)$ should satisfy, but without the definition or value of $f(k)$, the "Determine or estimate" part is not fully captured, though the structure for proving a specific bound is there. Since `f` is `noncomputable def ... := sorry`, it's a placeholder.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
