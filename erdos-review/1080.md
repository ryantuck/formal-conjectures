# Erdős Problem 1080 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices such that one part has $\lfloor n^{2/3}floor$ vertices. Is there a constant $c>0$ such that if $G$ has at least $cn$ edges then $G$ must contain a $C_6$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1080.lean`.

The formalization correctly sets up a bipartite graph with parts $X, Y$ where $|X| = \lfloor n^{2/3} floor$.
It asks for the existence of $c > 0$ such that $|E(G)| \ge cn$ implies the existence of a cycle of length 6.
This matches the problem statement exactly.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
