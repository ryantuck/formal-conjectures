# Erdős Problem 1076 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 5$ and let $\mathcal{F}_k$ be the family of all $3$-uniform hypergraphs with $k$ vertices and $k-2$ edges. Is it true that $\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\mathcal{F}_k)\sim \frac{n^2}{6}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1076.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the family $\mathcal{F}_k$ or the extremal number conjecture.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
