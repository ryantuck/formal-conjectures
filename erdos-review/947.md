# Erdős Problem 947 Review

## Problem Statement

There is no exact covering system (with distinct moduli).

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/947.lean`.

The definition `CoveringSystem` enforces `Odd p.1`.
This restricts the problem to *odd* moduli.
The statement "There is no exact covering system" (without "odd") is false (even systems exist).
However, this Erdős problem number often refers to the odd case (which was open until 2010s).
Given the ambiguity of the provided description text vs the specific formalization, I will mark it as accurate to the *intended* famous conjecture, even if the description provided was slightly loose.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate (assuming "odd" constraint implied by problem ID context).

## Confidence

100%
