# Erdős Problem 1054 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be the minimal integer $m$ such that $n$ is the sum of the $k$ smallest divisors of $m$ for some $k\geq 1$. Is it true that $f(n)=o(n)$? Or is this true only for almost all $n$, and $\limsup f(n)/n=\infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1054.lean`.

The function `f` is correctly defined.
The theorems `erdos_1054.parts.i`, `ii`, and `iii` correctly formalize the three possibilities mentioned in the problem (always $o(n)$, almost all $o(n)$, limsup infinite).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
