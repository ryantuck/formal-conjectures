# Erdős Problem 1040 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $F\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a closed infinite set, and let $\mu(F)$ be the infimum of $\lvert \{ z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}vert$, as $f$ ranges over all polynomials of the shape $\prod (z-z_i)$ with $z_i\in F$. Is $\mu(F)$ determined by the transfinite diameter of $F$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1040.lean`.

The quantity $\mu(F)$ and the transfinite diameter are defined.
The conjecture `logarithmic_capacity` asks if $\mu(F)$ is a function of the transfinite diameter, i.e., `μ F = f (transfiniteDiameter F)`.
This accurately captures the "determined by" condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
