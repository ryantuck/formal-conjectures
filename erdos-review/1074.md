# Erdős Problem 1074 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $S$ be the set of all $m\geq 1$ such that there exists a prime $p
ot\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such that $m!+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$. Does $\lim \frac{\lvert S\cap [1,x]vert}{x}$ exist?
Similarly for the set $P$ of primes.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1074.lean`.

The sets $S$ (EHSNumbers) and $P$ (PillaiPrimes) are correctly defined.
The theorems ask for the existence and value of the asymptotic densities of these sets (relative to $\mathbb{N}$ and the primes, respectively).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
