# Erdős Problem 1061 Review

## Problem Statement

How many solutions are there to $\sigma(a)+\sigma(b)=\sigma(a+b)$ with $a+b\leq x$, where $\sigma$ is the sum of divisors function? Is it $\sim cx$ for some constant $c>0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1061.lean`.

The function `S` counts the number of pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a+b \le x$ and $\sigma(a) + \sigma(b) = \sigma(a+b)$. The formalization uses `Finset.Icc 1 ⌊x⌋₊` for the range of $a$ and $b$, which implies $a, b \ge 1$, consistent with the domain of $\sigma$. The pairs are ordered, which is the standard interpretation unless "sets" or "unordered pairs" is specified.

The main conjecture `erdos_1061` asks whether there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that $S(x) \sim cx$ as $x 	o \infty$. This is formalized using `S ~[atTop] (fun x ↦ c * x)`, which corresponds to the asymptotic equivalence $S(x) / (cx) 	o 1$.

## Completeness

The formalization accurately captures the problem statement.
