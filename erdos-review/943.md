# Erdős Problem 943 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A$ be the set of powerful numbers. Is it true that $1_A\ast 1_A(n)=n^{o(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/943.lean`.

The formalization uses `sumRep` to represent the convolution (number of ways to write $n$ as sum of two powerful numbers).
The condition `= n^(o n)` with `o n -> 0` correctly captures $n^{o(1)}$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
