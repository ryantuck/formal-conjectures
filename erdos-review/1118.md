# Review: Erdos Problem 1118

**Problem:** Growth rate of entire functions with finite measure level sets
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1118](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1118)
**Status:** SOLVED (Hayman's conjecture proved by Camera 1977 and Gol'dberg 1979)

## Source Problem

Let f(z) be a non-constant entire function. Define E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c}. Two questions:

1. What is the minimum growth rate of f? Hayman conjectured that E(c) having finite planar measure implies the integral condition: integral_0^infinity r / (log log M(r)) dr < infinity, where M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|. This was proved by Camera (1977) and Gol'dberg (1979).

2. If E(c) has finite measure, must E(c') also have finite measure for some c' < c? Answered negatively by Gol'dberg (1979).

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem entire_function_level_set_measure (f : ℂ → ℂ)
    (hf : Differentiable ℂ f) (hnc : ¬∀ z, f z = f 0) :
    ∀ c : ℝ,
      volume {z : ℂ | c < ‖f z‖} < ⊤ →
        Integrable (fun r : ℝ =>
          r / Real.log (Real.log (⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖)))
          (volume.restrict (Set.Ioi 0)) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Correct overall structure (POSITIVE)

The rewrite is a massive improvement over the previous version (which was trivially false, claiming all functions have polynomial growth). The new version correctly:
- Takes f as an entire function (Differentiable C f)
- Requires f to be non-constant (hnc)
- Hypothesizes that E(c) has finite measure
- Concludes the integral condition

### 2. Non-constant condition (POSITIVE)

`¬∀ z, f z = f 0` correctly states that f is non-constant (not identically equal to a single value). This matches the source requirement.

### 3. Level set measure condition (POSITIVE)

`volume {z : ℂ | c < ‖f z‖} < ⊤` correctly expresses that E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c} has finite planar Lebesgue measure. The use of `c < ‖f z‖` (strict inequality) matches the source definition.

### 4. Integrable vs integral < infinity (MODERATE)

The conclusion uses `Integrable (fun r => r / log(log(M(r)))) (volume.restrict (Set.Ioi 0))`. In Mathlib, `Integrable` means the function is measurable and has finite integral (in the Lebesgue sense). The source states `∫_0^∞ r / log(log(M(r))) dr < ∞`, which is exactly integrability over (0, ∞). So `Integrable ... (volume.restrict (Set.Ioi 0))` correctly captures this.

However, there is a subtlety: `Integrable` in Mathlib requires the function to be `AEStronglyMeasurable` and have finite integral. The function `r / log(log(M(r)))` may not be defined when M(r) <= 1 (log <= 0) or M(r) <= e (log log <= 0), leading to division by zero or negative values. For small r, M(r) may be close to |f(0)|, which could make log log M(r) negative or undefined. The source integral likely implicitly starts from a large enough r where log log M(r) > 0. The formalization integrates over all of (0, infinity), which includes problematic values of r near 0. This could make the integrand undefined or negative for small r.

In practice, `Real.log` in Lean returns a real number for all inputs (log of non-positive values is defined as some value, typically 0 or extended). So `Real.log (Real.log x)` is always a real number, but it may be 0 when log x <= 0, causing division by zero (r / 0 = 0 in Lean's real number division). This means the integrand is 0 for small r where M(r) is small, which makes the integrability condition slightly stronger than intended (it includes non-problematic small r contributions of 0). This is actually fine and arguably correct.

### 5. M(r) definition via iSup (MODERATE)

`⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖` defines M(r) as the supremum of |f(z)| on the circle of radius r. As discussed for other problems, this is mathematically correct but uses a dependent iSup. For r > 0, the circle is nonempty and compact, and |f| is continuous, so the supremum is attained. For r = 0, the "circle" is just {0} and the sup is |f(0)|. For r < 0, the set is empty and iSup returns 0 (bot in the conditionally complete lattice). Since we integrate over (0, infinity), only positive r values matter, and the definition is correct there.

### 6. Only formalizes Question 1 (MINOR)

The source has two questions. The formalization only addresses Question 1 (the integral growth condition). Question 2 (whether E(c) finite implies E(c') finite for c' < c, answered negatively) is not formalized. This is acceptable since Question 1 is the main result and formalization of Question 2 would require a separate theorem.

### 7. Universal quantification over c (POSITIVE)

The statement `∀ c : ℝ, volume {z : ℂ | c < ‖f z‖} < ⊤ → ...` says: for every c, if E(c) has finite measure, then the integral condition holds. This is correct: the source result is that the integral condition follows from finite measure of ANY level set E(c).

## What a proper formalization would look like

The current formalization is quite good. A potential improvement would be to restrict the integration domain to avoid the small-r region where log log M(r) may be non-positive:

```lean
theorem entire_function_level_set_measure (f : ℂ → ℂ)
    (hf : Differentiable ℂ f) (hnc : ¬∀ z, f z = f 0) :
    ∀ c : ℝ,
      volume {z : ℂ | c < ‖f z‖} < ⊤ →
        Integrable (fun r : ℝ =>
          r / Real.log (Real.log (⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖)))
          (volume.restrict (Set.Ioi 0)) := by
  sorry
```

This is identical to the current version. The formalization is essentially correct as stated.

## Confidence: **78%**

The formalization captures the main result accurately: for a non-constant entire function f, if the level set E(c) has finite planar measure, then the integral of r / log(log(M(r))) over (0, infinity) is finite. The quantifier structure, the key mathematical objects (level set measure, M(r), the integral condition), and the hypotheses all match the source. The main concerns are minor: the behavior of log(log(M(r))) for small r where it may be non-positive (handled gracefully by Lean's real division returning 0 for division by 0), and the fact that only Question 1 of the source is formalized. This is a strong formalization.
