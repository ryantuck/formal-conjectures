# Review: Erdos Problem 1118

**Problem:** Growth rate of entire functions with finite measure level sets
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1118](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1118)
**Status:** SOLVED (Hayman's conjecture proved by Camera 1977 and Gol'dberg 1979; second question answered negatively by Gol'dberg)

## Source Problem

Let f(z) be a non-constant entire function. Define E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c}. Two questions:

1. What is the minimum growth rate of f? Hayman conjectured that the condition E(c) has finite planar measure implies integral_0^infinity r / (log log M(r)) dr < infinity, where M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|. This was proved by Camera and Gol'dberg.

2. If E(c) has finite measure, must E(c') also have finite measure for some c' < c? Answered negatively by Gol'dberg.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem entire_function_level_set_measure :
    ∀ (f : ℂ → ℂ), (∃ c : ℝ, True) → -- Placeholder: level sets have finite measure
      ∃ (M : ℝ) (k : ℝ), ∀ z : ℂ, ‖f z‖ ≤ M * (1 + ‖z‖) ^ k := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Hypothesis is vacuous (CRITICAL)

The hypothesis `(∃ c : ℝ, True)` is trivially true (take any c). It is meant to be a placeholder for "E(c) has finite measure" but carries no content. So the formalization claims: for ALL functions f : C -> C, there exist M, k such that |f(z)| <= M * (1 + |z|)^k. This says every function has polynomial growth, which is obviously false (e.g., e^z).

### 2. Conclusion is wrong (CRITICAL)

The conclusion says f has polynomial growth: |f(z)| <= M * (1 + |z|)^k. But:
- The source problem is about the relationship between finite measure of level sets and growth characterized by integral_0^infinity r / (log log M(r)) dr < infinity. This integral condition is very different from polynomial growth.
- An entire function with polynomial growth is a polynomial. The problem is about general entire functions (including those of infinite order), not just polynomials.

### 3. Missing finite measure condition on E(c) (CRITICAL)

The key hypothesis -- that the set {z : |f(z)| > c} has finite planar Lebesgue measure -- is replaced by `True`. This is the central condition of the problem.

### 4. Missing the integral growth characterization (CRITICAL)

The solved result is that E(c) having finite measure implies integral_0^infinity r / (log log M(r)) dr < infinity. The formalization replaces this with polynomial growth, which is a completely different (and much stronger) condition.

### 5. Missing entireness condition (MODERATE)

The source requires f to be an entire function. The formalization has `f : C -> C` with no differentiability condition.

### 6. Does not address the second question (MODERATE)

The source also asks whether finite measure of E(c) implies finite measure of E(c') for c' < c (answered negatively). The formalization makes no attempt to address either question properly.

### 7. Statement is trivially false (CRITICAL)

As noted, the formalization claims every function C -> C has polynomial growth, which is false.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- If f is a non-constant entire function and E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c}
    has finite planar measure for some c, then
    ∫ r in [0, ∞), r / log(log(M(r))) < ∞ where M(r) = sup_{|z|=r} |f(z)| -/
theorem entire_function_level_set_measure (f : ℂ → ℂ)
    (hf : Differentiable ℂ f) (hnc : ¬∀ z, f z = f 0) :
    ∀ c : ℝ,
      MeasureTheory.volume {z : ℂ | c < ‖f z‖} < ⊤ →
        ∫ (r : ℝ) in Set.Ioi 0,
          r / Real.log (Real.log (⨆ z : Metric.sphere (0 : ℂ) r, ‖f z‖)) < ⊤ := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization is trivially false (claims all functions have polynomial growth) due to the vacuous hypothesis. The actual mathematical content -- finite measure of level sets, the integral growth characterization -- is entirely absent.
