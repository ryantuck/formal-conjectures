# Review: Erdos Problem 1164

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1164.lean`
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1164](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1164)
**Status:** SOLVED (Revesz, Kesten; stronger result by Dembo-Peres-Rosen-Zeitouni)

## Original Problem

Let $R_n$ denote the maximal integer such that almost every random walk from the origin in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ visits every $x$ with $\|x\| \leq R_n$ in at most $n$ steps.

Main result: $\log R_n \asymp \sqrt{\log n}$ (i.e., $\log R_n = \Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$).

Stronger distributional result: $\lim_{n \to \infty} P((\log R_n)^2 / \log n \leq x) = e^{-4x}$ for all $x > 0$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem random_walk_coverage_radius :
    answer(True) ↔
      ∃ (R : ℕ → ℝ) (C₁ C₂ : ℝ), C₁ > 0 ∧ C₂ > 0 ∧
        ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
          C₁ * Real.sqrt (Real.log n) ≤ Real.log (R n) ∧
          Real.log (R n) ≤ C₂ * Real.sqrt (Real.log n) := by

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(True)` for solved problem |
| Sandwich bound (Θ-notation) | Yes | `C₁ * √(log n) ≤ log(R n) ≤ C₂ * √(log n)` |
| Eventually for large $n$ | Yes | `∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop` |
| Positive constants | Yes | `C₁ > 0 ∧ C₂ > 0` |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research solved, AMS 60]` (Probability) |

### Critical issues

1. **Trivially true (Critical):** Take $R(n) = e^{\sqrt{\log n}}$, $C_1 = C_2 = 1$. The existential is satisfied without any reference to random walks.

2. **$R_n$ is a specific probabilistic quantity:** It is defined through random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, involving probability measures and "almost surely" quantification. None of this is present.

3. **Θ-notation vs. asymptotic equivalence:** The original source says $\log R_n \asymp \sqrt{\log n}$, which is the $\Theta$-notation (sandwich between constants). The formalization correctly captures this as a two-sided bound. This is accurate to the source.

4. **Stronger distributional result not captured:** The limiting distribution $P((\log R_n)^2 / \log n \leq x) \to e^{-4x}$ is mentioned in the docstring but not formalized. This is understandable given the infrastructure requirements.

### Good aspects

- The sandwich bound structure with positive constants is the correct encoding of $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$
- `∀ᶠ in atTop` is the right way to express "for all large n"
- The docstring is informative with proper attribution

## Verdict

**Confidence: 10%**

The asymptotic form ($\Theta$-notation sandwich) is correctly encoded, but the statement is trivially true because $R_n$ is existentially quantified rather than defined from the random walk process.
