# Review of Erdos Problem 562

## Problem Statement
Let $R_r(n)$ denote the $r$-uniform hypergraph Ramsey number. Prove that, for $r \ge 3$,
$$ \log_{r-1} R_r(n) \asymp_r n, $$
where $\log_{r-1}$ denotes the $(r-1)$-fold iterated logarithm.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization uses `hypergraphRamsey r n` and expresses the asymptotic relationship using `~[atTop]`.

```lean
theorem erdos_562 : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ r ≥ 3, (fun n ↦ log^[r - 1] (hypergraphRamsey r n)) ~[atTop] (fun n ↦ (n : ℝ)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization appears to capture the essence of the problem.
- `hypergraphRamsey r n` corresponds to $R_r(n)$.
- `log^[r - 1]` corresponds to the iterated logarithm.
- `~[atTop]` corresponds to asymptotic equivalence. The problem uses $\asymp_r$, which often means "of the same order" (Theta notation) rather than asymptotic equivalence (limit of ratio is 1). However, `~[atTop]` in Lean (`IsEquivalent`) is the limit ratio 1 relation. If the problem intends the stronger statement (or if the formalizer interpreted it as such), this is correct. Given the "Prove that" nature, the use of `answer(sorry)` is slightly unusual (usually for open problems/determinations), but acceptable.
- `hypergraphRamsey` is assumed to be defined in imports.
