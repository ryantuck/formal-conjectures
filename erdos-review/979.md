# Erdős Problem 979 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_k(n)$ count the number of solutions to $n=p_1^k+\cdots+p_k^k$. Is it true that $\limsup f_k(n)=\infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/979.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_979` correctly asks if the limsup of the solution count is infinite.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
