# Review of Erdos Problem 639

## Problem Statement
If $K_n$ is 2-colored, at most $n^2/4$ edges are not in a monochromatic triangle?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts this bound.

```lean
theorem two_coloring_monochromatic_triangles (n : ℕ) :
    ∀ (coloring : Fin n × Fin n → Fin 2),
      sorry ≤ n^2 / 4
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton (`sorry ≤ ...`). The quantity "edges not in monochromatic triangle" is not defined.

## Confidence
90% (Quantity stubbed)
