# Review: Erdos Problem 1116

**Problem:** Meromorphic functions with unbounded ratio of root counts
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1116](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1116)
**Status:** SOLVED (affirmatively, by Gol'dberg and Toppila independently)

## Source Problem

For a meromorphic function f, let n(r, a) denote the number of roots of f(z) = a within the disc |z| < r. Does there exist a meromorphic (or entire) function f such that for every pair of distinct values a != b:

  lim sup_{r -> infinity} n(r, a) / n(r, b) = infinity?

Answered affirmatively: such entire functions do exist.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem meromorphic_root_distribution :
    ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), ∃ (roots : Set ℂ),
      roots.Infinite ∧ -- f has infinitely many roots (placeholder)
      (∀ z ∈ roots, True) := by -- Some property about root distribution
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Statement is vacuous / trivially true (CRITICAL)

The RHS simplifies to: there exists f : C -> C and an infinite set "roots" such that for all z in roots, True. This is trivially true: take any f, and roots = C (or any infinite subset). The `True` placeholder carries no content.

### 2. No root-counting function n(r, a) (CRITICAL)

The source problem centers on the function n(r, a) = #{z : |z| < r, f(z) = a}. This is entirely absent from the formalization.

### 3. No lim sup condition (CRITICAL)

The key property -- lim sup n(r,a)/n(r,b) = infinity for all a != b -- is completely missing. This is the entire substance of the problem.

### 4. No meromorphic/entire function condition (CRITICAL)

The formalization uses `f : C -> C` with no analyticity, meromorphicity, or holomorphicity condition. The source requires f to be meromorphic or entire.

### 5. "roots" is disconnected from f (CRITICAL)

The set "roots" is existentially quantified independently of f. There is no condition linking roots to the zeros of f or the preimages f^{-1}(a).

### 6. Missing the universal quantification over value pairs (CRITICAL)

The source requires the lim sup condition for ALL pairs a != b. The formalization has no such quantification.

### 7. Should not use answer elaborator (MINOR)

Since the problem is solved affirmatively (such functions exist), the statement should be a direct existential claim, not wrapped in answer(sorry). The current formalization does not use answer(sorry), which is correct in form, but the content is vacuous.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- There exists an entire function f such that for every pair of
    distinct complex values a ≠ b,
    lim sup_{r→∞} n(r,a)/n(r,b) = ∞ -/
theorem meromorphic_root_distribution :
    ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), Differentiable ℂ f ∧
      ∀ (a b : ℂ), a ≠ b →
        Filter.atTop.Limsup
          (fun r : ℝ => (Finset.card (sorry : Finset ℂ) : ℝ) /  -- n(r,a)
                        (Finset.card (sorry : Finset ℂ) : ℝ))    -- n(r,b)
          = ⊤ := by
  sorry
```

Note: Properly defining n(r, a) = #{z in disc of radius r : f(z) = a} in Lean would require careful treatment of the zero set of a holomorphic function, which has discrete fibers.

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization is a trivially true stub with no mathematical content. Every aspect of the source problem -- the root counting function, the lim sup ratio condition, the universal quantification over value pairs, and the analyticity condition -- is absent.
