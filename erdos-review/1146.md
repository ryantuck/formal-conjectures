# Review: Erdos Problem 1146

**Problem:** Is B = {2^m * 3^n} an essential component?
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1146](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1146)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

A set A ⊆ ℕ is called an essential component if d_s(A + B) > d_s(B) for every B ⊆ ℕ with 0 < d_s(B) < 1, where d_s denotes Schnirelmann density.

Is B = {2^m * 3^n : m, n ≥ 0} an essential component?

Ruzsa remarks this is "the simplest set with a chance to be an essential component" and that he does not "even have a plausible guess" about the answer. Related to Problem #37.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem powers_two_three_essential :
    let B := {n : ℕ | ∃ m k : ℕ, n = 2^m * 3^k}
    answer(sorry) ↔ (∀ A : Set ℕ, Set.Infinite A → A ∩ B ≠ ∅) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Definition of "essential component" is completely wrong (CRITICAL)

The formalization defines B being an "essential component" as: every infinite set A intersects B. This is trivially false — for example, the set of primes greater than 3 is infinite and disjoint from B = {2^m * 3^n} (since 3-smooth numbers have no prime factors > 3).

The actual definition of essential component involves Schnirelmann density: A is an essential component if for every set B with 0 < d_s(B) < 1, we have d_s(A + B) > d_s(B). In other words, adding A to any set B with intermediate Schnirelmann density strictly increases the density. This is a deep additive combinatorics concept, not a simple intersection property.

### 2. Missing Schnirelmann density (CRITICAL)

The Schnirelmann density d_s(A) = inf_{n≥1} |A ∩ {1,...,n}| / n is a fundamental concept needed for this problem. It is not defined or referenced in the formalization.

### 3. Missing sumset structure (CRITICAL)

The essential component property is about the SUMSET A + B increasing Schnirelmann density. The formalization has no sumset and no density comparison.

### 4. Definition of B is correct (GOOD)

`B := {n : ℕ | ∃ m k : ℕ, n = 2^m * 3^k}` correctly defines the set of 3-smooth numbers (numbers whose only prime factors are 2 and 3). This matches the source's B = {2^m * 3^n}.

### 5. answer(sorry) usage is correct (GOOD)

Using `answer(sorry)` for this open yes/no question is appropriate.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- Schnirelmann density of a set of natural numbers -/
noncomputable def schnirelmannDensity (A : Set ℕ) : ℝ :=
  ⨅ (n : ℕ) (_ : 0 < n),
    ((Finset.filter (· ∈ A) (Finset.Icc 1 n)).card : ℝ) / n

/-- A set is an essential component if adding it to any set with
    intermediate Schnirelmann density strictly increases the density -/
def IsEssentialComponent (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ B : Set ℕ, 0 < schnirelmannDensity B → schnirelmannDensity B < 1 →
    schnirelmannDensity {n | ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ B, n = a + b} > schnirelmannDensity B

    let B := {n : ℕ | ∃ m k : ℕ, n = 2^m * 3^k}
    answer(sorry) ↔ IsEssentialComponent B := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **3%**

The only correct element is the definition of B as 3-smooth numbers. The core concept — essential component via Schnirelmann density — is replaced with a trivially false intersection property. The formalization has no density, no sumset, and no density comparison. This needs a complete rewrite with proper definitions of Schnirelmann density and the essential component property.
