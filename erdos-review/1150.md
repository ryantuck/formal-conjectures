# Review: Erdos Problem 1150

**Problem:** Ultraflat polynomials with ±1 coefficients
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1150](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1150)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Does there exist a constant c > 0 such that, for all large n and all polynomials P of degree n with coefficients ±1,

  max_{|z|=1} |P(z)| > (1+c)√n?

The trivial lower bound max_{|z|=1} |P(z)| ≥ √n follows from Parseval's theorem. An affirmative answer would mean no "ultraflat" ±1 polynomial exists. If coefficients are allowed to take arbitrary values on the unit circle, ultraflat polynomials do exist (see Problem 230).

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem ultraflat_polynomials :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (P : ℕ → Polynomial ℂ),
        (∀ n i, (P n).coeff i ∈ ({-1, 1} : Set ℂ)) ∧
        True := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Statement is vacuous (CRITICAL)

The formalization says "there exists a sequence of ±1 polynomials and True", which is trivially true. The `True` conjunction adds no content. The statement reduces to the existence of any polynomial with ±1 coefficients, which is trivially satisfiable (e.g., P(x) = 1 for all n).

### 2. Quantifier structure is reversed (CRITICAL)

The source asks: **for ALL** ±1 polynomials of degree n, is max_{|z|=1} |P(z)| > (1+c)√n? This is a **universal** statement about all such polynomials. The formalization uses an **existential** quantifier, which reverses the meaning entirely.

### 3. Key inequality completely missing (CRITICAL)

The entire mathematical substance — the bound max_{|z|=1} |P(z)| > (1+c)√n — is absent. This is the core of the problem: whether the Parseval lower bound √n can be improved by a multiplicative constant (1+c) uniformly for all ±1 polynomials.

### 4. Missing degree constraint

The source specifies "polynomials P of degree n" — the degree should be exactly n. The formalization imposes no degree constraint on P(n).

### 5. Missing circle norm

The formalization would need the sup norm on the unit circle: ⨆ z with |z| = 1, ‖P.eval z‖. This is entirely absent.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem ultraflat_polynomials :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (c : ℝ), c > 0 ∧
        ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
          ∀ (P : Polynomial ℂ), P.natDegree = n →
            (∀ i, P.coeff i ∈ ({-1, 0, 1} : Set ℂ)) →
            P.coeff n ∈ ({-1, 1} : Set ℂ) →
            ⨆ z ∈ Metric.sphere (0 : ℂ) 1,
              ‖P.eval z‖ > (1 + c) * Real.sqrt n := by
  sorry
```

(With the coefficient constraint requiring exactly ±1 for all indices 0 through n.)

## Confidence: **2%**

Only the coefficient constraint {-1, 1} appears. The quantifier structure, the key inequality, the degree constraint, and the unit circle norm are all missing. The statement as written is trivially true.
