# Erdős Problem 204 Review

## Problem Statement

Existence of covering systems with moduli from divisors of $n$, 'almost disjoint'.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/204.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_204` asks if `answer(False)` corresponds to existence (Adenwalla disproved). Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
