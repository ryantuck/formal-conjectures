# Erdős Problem 1037 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices in which every degree occurs at most twice, and the number of distinct degree is $>(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)n$. Must $G$ contain a trivial (empty or complete) subgraph of size 'much larger' than $\log n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1037.lean`.

The formalization assumes `∀ v w : Fin n, v ≠ w → G.degree v ≠ G.degree w`, which implies all degrees are distinct. This is a special case of the problem statement ("every degree occurs at most twice"), but much stronger. The problem statement allows degrees to repeat once.
Also, the condition "number of distinct degrees $> (1/2+\epsilon)n$" is replaced by "all $n$ degrees distinct" (which is $> (1/2+\epsilon)n$ for small $\epsilon$, but less general).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect/too specific.
