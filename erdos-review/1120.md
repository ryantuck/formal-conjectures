# Review: Erdos Problem 1120

**Problem:** Path length in polynomial level set
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1120](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1120)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let f be a monic polynomial of degree n with all roots satisfying |z| <= 1. Define E = {z : |f(z)| <= 1}. What is the shortest length of a path in E connecting z = 0 to the circle |z| = 1? Clunie and Netanyahu showed such a path always exists. Erdos conjectured that the shortest path length "presumably tends to infinity with n, but not too fast."

## Current Formalization

theorem path_length_polynomial_level_set :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      Filter.Tendsto
        (fun n : ℕ =>
          ⨅ (P : Polynomial ℂ) (_ : P.Monic) (_ : P.natDegree = n)
            (_ : ∀ z, P.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1)
            (γ : C(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ℂ))
            (_ : γ ⟨0, ⟨le_refl _, zero_le_one⟩⟩ = 0)
            (_ : ‖γ ⟨1, ⟨zero_le_one, le_refl _⟩⟩‖ = 1)
            (_ : ∀ t, ‖P.eval (γ t)‖ ≤ 1),
            (0 : ℝ))

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Correct overall structure (POSITIVE)

The formalization correctly captures Erdos's conjecture as a tendsto-atTop statement: the infimum (over all eligible polynomials and paths) of some quantity tends to infinity with n. The `answer(sorry)` wrapper is appropriate for an open problem. The quantifier structure -- for each n, take the infimum over all monic polynomials of degree n with roots in the unit disk, over all continuous paths in E from 0 to the unit circle -- is exactly right.

### 2. Polynomial constraints are correct (POSITIVE)

`P.Monic`, `P.natDegree = n`, and `∀ z, P.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1` correctly encode the source's "monic polynomial of degree n whose roots all satisfy |z| <= 1."

### 3. Path conditions are correct (POSITIVE)

- `γ : C(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ℂ)` ensures the path is a continuous function [0,1] -> C.
- `γ ⟨0, ...⟩ = 0` starts the path at z = 0.
- `‖γ ⟨1, ...⟩‖ = 1` ends on the unit circle |z| = 1.
- `∀ t, ‖P.eval (γ t)‖ ≤ 1` ensures the entire path lies inside E = {z : |f(z)| <= 1}.

### 4. The infimum is over (0 : R) rather than arc length (CRITICAL)

The expression being taken as an infimum is `(0 : ℝ)`, a constant zero, rather than the arc length of the path gamma. The Tendsto statement says the infimum of the constant 0 (over all valid choices) tends to infinity, which is mathematically incoherent -- the infimum of a bunch of zeros is zero for every n, so the statement inside the biconditional is false. This means the answer would have to be `False` for the biconditional to hold, which does not match the expected conjecture.

The formalization needs to replace `(0 : ℝ)` with the arc length (or total variation) of the path gamma. Defining arc length for a continuous path in Lean/Mathlib requires some care. One approach would be to use `eVariationOn` or a similar construct to compute the length of the curve.

### 5. Endpoint on unit circle: norm equals 1 vs specific point (MINOR)

The source says the path connects 0 to "the unit circle |z| = 1." The formalization uses `‖γ ⟨1, ...⟩‖ = 1`, meaning the endpoint has modulus exactly 1. This is correct -- the path just needs to reach some point on the unit circle, not a specific point.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 30]
theorem path_length_polynomial_level_set :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      Filter.Tendsto
        (fun n : ℕ =>
          ⨅ (P : Polynomial ℂ) (_ : P.Monic) (_ : P.natDegree = n)
            (_ : ∀ z, P.IsRoot z → ‖z‖ ≤ 1)
            (γ : C(Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ℂ))
            (_ : γ ⟨0, ⟨le_refl _, zero_le_one⟩⟩ = 0)
            (_ : ‖γ ⟨1, ⟨zero_le_one, le_refl _⟩⟩‖ = 1)
            (_ : ∀ t, ‖P.eval (γ t)‖ ≤ 1),
            eVariationOn (fun t : ℝ => γ ⟨t, sorry⟩) (Set.Icc 0 1))
        Filter.atTop Filter.atTop := by
  sorry
```

The key fix is replacing `(0 : ℝ)` with an actual arc length computation. The exact Lean spelling for "arc length of gamma" may involve `eVariationOn` or a similar Mathlib definition, but the core idea is clear: the infimized quantity must be the length of the path, not a constant zero.

## Confidence: **40%**

The formalization has the right high-level structure: quantifier ordering, polynomial constraints, continuous path, path endpoint conditions, path containment in E, and the tendsto-atTop statement. This is a dramatic improvement over the previous version. However, the critical flaw is that the quantity being infimized is `(0 : ℝ)` rather than the arc length of the path, which makes the actual mathematical statement incoherent. Fixing this single issue would bring the formalization to a high confidence level.
