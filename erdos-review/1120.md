# Review: Erdos Problem 1120

**Problem:** Path length in polynomial level set
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1120](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1120)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let f be a monic polynomial of degree n with all roots satisfying |z| <= 1. Define E = {z : |f(z)| <= 1}. What is the shortest length of a path in E connecting z = 0 to the circle |z| = 1?

Clunie and Netanyahu showed that such a path always exists. Erdos conjectured that the shortest path length tends to infinity with n.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 30]
theorem path_length_polynomial_level_set (P : Polynomial ℂ) (c : ℂ) :
    ∃ (L : ℝ), 0 ≤ L ∧
      (∀ path : ℝ → ℂ, (∀ t, P.eval (path t) = c) →
        True) ∧ -- Placeholder for path length bound condition
      L ≤ (P.natDegree : ℝ) * (1 + ‖c‖) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Wrong mathematical setup (CRITICAL)

The source problem considers the sublevel set E = {z : |f(z)| <= 1} and asks about paths *within* E connecting 0 to the unit circle |z| = 1. The formalization instead considers paths along a *level set* {z : P(z) = c} for an arbitrary polynomial and constant, which is a completely different geometric object.

### 2. Vacuous True placeholder (CRITICAL)

The conjunction with `True` makes the path condition vacuous. The statement reduces to: "there exists L >= 0 such that L <= degree * (1 + |c|)", which is trivially true by taking L = 0. This captures none of the problem's content.

### 3. Missing monic and root constraints (CRITICAL)

The source requires f to be monic and all roots to satisfy |z| <= 1. The formalization takes an arbitrary polynomial P with no constraints whatsoever on its leading coefficient or root locations.

### 4. Wrong question structure (CRITICAL)

The source asks: "What is the shortest path length?" and specifically conjectures it tends to infinity with n. This is a *lower bound* question asking whether the minimum path length grows. The formalization instead provides an *upper bound* L <= n * (1 + |c|), which is the opposite direction and not what the problem asks.

### 5. Missing path continuity and connectivity

Even ignoring the above, the "path" in the formalization is an arbitrary function R -> C with no continuity requirement, and there is no condition that it connects z = 0 to |z| = 1.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
-- The problem asks about the shortest path in E = {z : |f(z)| <= 1}
-- connecting 0 to the unit circle, for monic f of degree n with roots in the closed unit disk.
-- Erdos conjectured this shortest length tends to infinity with n.

(The arc length of gamma would need its own definition, making full formalization quite involved.)

## Confidence: **2%**

The formalization is entirely placeholder. The mathematical setup (level set vs sublevel set), the constraints (monic, roots in disk), the question direction (lower bound vs upper bound), and the path conditions (continuity, endpoints, containment in E) are all wrong or absent. The statement as written is trivially true.
