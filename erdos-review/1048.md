# Erdős Problem 1048 Review

## Problem Statement

If $f\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ is a monic polynomial with all roots satisfying $\lvert zvert \leq r$ for some $r<2$, then must $\{ z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}$ have a connected component with diameter $>2-r$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1048.lean`.

The theorem `level_set_diameter` correctly formalizes the hypothesis on roots and the conclusion about the existence of a connected component of the level set with diameter strictly greater than $2-r$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
