# Erdős Problem 925 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a constant $\delta>0$ such that, for all large $n$, if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices which is not Ramsey for $K_3$ (i.e. there exists a 2-colouring of the edges of $G$ with no monochromatic triangle) then $G$ contains an independent set of size $\gg n^{1/3+\delta}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/925.lean`.

The formalization `not_independent_ramsey` posits that for all $G$, if $G$ is $K_k$-free and $\overline{G}$ is $K_k$-free, then $\alpha(G)$ is large.
This seems to address the Ramsey number $R(k,k)$ bounds (Erdos-Szekeres), not the specific problem about graphs that are not Ramsey for $K_3$.
The condition "not Ramsey for $K_3$" means $G 
ot	o (K_3)_2$.
The formalization uses `CliqueFree k`.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
