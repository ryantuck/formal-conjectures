# Erdős Problem 954 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $a_k$ be a sequence defined by subset sum solution counts. Is the number of solutions to $a_i+a_j \leq x$ equal to $x+O(x^{1/4+o(1)})$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/954.lean`.

The theorem `sequence_sum_growth` asks if the difference between the solution count and $x$ is dominated by $x^{1/4+c}$.
This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
