# Erdős Problem 86 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every subgraph of $Q_n$ with slightly more than half the edges contain a $C_4$?

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/86.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_86` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this property. Matches.

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
