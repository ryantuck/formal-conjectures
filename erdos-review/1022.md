# Erdős Problem 1022 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a constant $c_t 	o \infty$ such that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite family of sets of size at least $t$, and for every set $X$ there are $< c_t|X|$ many $A\in \mathcal{F}$ with $A\subseteq X$, then $\mathcal{F}$ has property B (chromatic number 2)?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1022.lean`.

The formalization asks: `∃ (m : ℕ), ∀ (H : Finset (Finset α)) ..., m ≤ H.card → ∃ (c : α → Fin 2), ...`.
This merely asks if any hypergraph with enough edges has property B, which is false (e.g., Fano plane has 7 edges, no property B, but one can make arbitrarily large hypergraphs without property B by disjoint union).
Crucially, the condition "for every set $X$ there are $< c_t|X|$ many $A\in \mathcal{F}$ with $A\subseteq X$" is completely missing.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
