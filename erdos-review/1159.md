# Review: Erdos Problem 1159

**Problem:** Blocking sets in projective planes
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1159](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1159)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Determine whether there exists a constant C > 1 such that for every finite projective plane P, there exists a set of points S (a blocking set) where 1 ≤ |S ∩ ℓ| ≤ C for all lines ℓ.

Known: Erdős, Silverman, Stein (1983) proved such sets exist with |S ∩ ℓ| ≪ log n for all lines (n = order of the plane). A stronger variant is Problem 664.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem blocking_sets_uniform_bound :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (C : ℕ), C > 1 ∧
        ∀ (ProjectivePlane Line : Type*),
        ∃ (BlockingSet : Set ProjectivePlane)
          (incidence : ProjectivePlane → Line → Prop),
          ∀ (ℓ : Line),
            let intersection := {p : ProjectivePlane | p ∈ BlockingSet ∧ incidence p ℓ}
            1 ≤ intersection.ncard ∧ intersection.ncard ≤ C := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Incidence relation is existentially quantified — trivially satisfiable (CRITICAL)

The formalization lets us **choose** the incidence relation. This completely undermines the problem. Given any types ProjectivePlane and Line:
- Pick any point p₀ ∈ ProjectivePlane
- Set BlockingSet = {p₀}
- Define incidence p ℓ := (p = p₀) for all ℓ
- Then for each ℓ: intersection = {p₀}, ncard = 1
- This satisfies 1 ≤ 1 ∧ 1 ≤ C for any C ≥ 1

The incidence relation should be **given** (part of the universal quantification over projective planes), not existentially quantified.

### 2. Missing projective plane axioms (CRITICAL)

A finite projective plane has specific axioms:
1. Any two distinct points determine a unique line
2. Any two distinct lines meet in a unique point
3. There exist four points, no three collinear (non-degeneracy)

The formalization quantifies over arbitrary types (ProjectivePlane, Line) with no axioms. Any pair of types qualifies.

### 3. Missing finiteness constraint (MAJOR)

The problem specifically asks about **finite** projective planes. The formalization has no Fintype constraint on ProjectivePlane or Line.

### 4. Missing blocking set constraint (MAJOR)

A blocking set must intersect **every** line. The formalization's intersection condition `1 ≤ intersection.ncard` partially captures this (every line hits at least one point of S), but only because the blocking property is combined with the uniform bound. However, since the incidence relation is chosen by the prover, this is moot.

### 5. Using ncard is appropriate (MINOR POSITIVE)

`Set.ncard` works for possibly infinite sets (returning 0 for infinite sets), which is fine here since everything should be finite.

### 6. The high-level question format is correct (MINOR POSITIVE)

Using `answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ C > 1, ∀ planes, ...` correctly captures "does there exist a uniform constant C?"

## What a proper formalization would need

A projective plane structure:

```lean
/-- A finite projective plane with points, lines, and incidence relation. -/
structure FiniteProjectivePlane where
  Point : Type*
  Line : Type*
  [finPoint : Fintype Point]
  [finLine : Fintype Line]
  incident : Point → Line → Prop
  two_points_line : ∀ p q : Point, p ≠ q → ∃! ℓ : Line, incident p ℓ ∧ incident q ℓ
  two_lines_point : ∀ ℓ₁ ℓ₂ : Line, ℓ₁ ≠ ℓ₂ → ∃! p : Point, incident p ℓ₁ ∧ incident p ℓ₂
  nondegen : ∃ a b c d : Point, a ≠ b ∧ a ≠ c ∧ a ≠ d ∧ b ≠ c ∧ b ≠ d ∧ c ≠ d ∧
    ∀ ℓ : Line, ¬(incident a ℓ ∧ incident b ℓ ∧ incident c ℓ) -- etc.

theorem blocking_sets_uniform_bound :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (C : ℕ), C > 1 ∧
        ∀ (P : FiniteProjectivePlane),
          ∃ (S : Set P.Point),
            ∀ (ℓ : P.Line),
              let I := {p : P.Point | p ∈ S ∧ P.incident p ℓ}
              1 ≤ I.ncard ∧ I.ncard ≤ C := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

The high-level structure (∃ C > 1, ∀ planes, ∃ blocking set, uniform bound) is identifiable, but the statement is trivially satisfiable because the incidence relation is existentially quantified and there are no projective plane axioms. Every aspect of the mathematical content beyond "∃ C > 1" is missing or broken.
