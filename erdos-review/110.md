# Erdős Problem 110 Review

## Problem Statement

Does $\chi(G)=\aleph_1$ imply finite subgraphs with $\chi(H)=n$ and bounded size?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/110.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_110` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a bound. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
