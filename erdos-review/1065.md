# Erdős Problem 1065 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p=2^kq+1$ for some prime $q$ and $k\geq 0$? Or $p=2^k3^lq+1$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1065.lean`.

The first question is formalized as `erdos_1065a`: `Set.Infinite {p | ∃ q k, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p = 2^k * q + 1}`.
The second question is formalized as `erdos_1065b`: `Set.Infinite {p | ∃ q k l, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p = 2^k * 3^l * q + 1}`.

Both formalizations correctly express the condition of "infinitely many primes".

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and correct.

## Confidence

100%
