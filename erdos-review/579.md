# Review of Erdos Problem 579

## Problem Statement
If $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no $K_{2,2,2}$ and at least $\delta n^2$ edges, then $G$ contains an independent set of size $\gg n$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for an independent set of size $\ge c \cdot n$.

```lean
theorem dense_octahedron_free_independent_set (δ : ℝ) (hδ : δ > 0) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop, ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
      (∀ (f : Fin 6 ↪ Fin n), ¬ ∀ i j, octahedron.Adj i j ↔ G.Adj (f i) (f j)) →
      G.edgeSet.ncard ≥ Nat.floor (δ * n^2) →
      ∃ (S : Finset (Fin n)), ... S.card ≥ Nat.floor (c * n)
```

## Critique
- "no $K_{2,2,2}$": The formalization uses `↔` in the forbidden subgraph condition: `¬ ∀ i j, octahedron.Adj i j ↔ G.Adj (f i) (f j)`. This forbids *induced* copies of the octahedron.
- Usually "no $H$" means no subgraph $H$.
- If $G$ forbids subgraph $K_{2,2,2}$, it also forbids induced $K_{2,2,2}$? No, forbidding subgraph is stronger. If you forbid subgraph, you definitely don't have it induced.
- But if you only forbid induced, you might have it as a non-induced subgraph (more edges).
- The formalization forbids *induced* $K_{2,2,2}$.
- The problem likely implies "no subgraph $K_{2,2,2}$".
- `G.edgeSet.ncard ≥ δ n^2`: Dense graph.
- `S.card ≥ c * n`: Linear size independent set.
- The use of induced subgraph for the forbidden condition is suspect.

## Confidence
80% (Potential subgraph vs induced mismatch)
