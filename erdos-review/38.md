# Erdős Problem 38 Review

## Problem Statement

Does there exist $B$ which is not an additive basis, but boosts Schnirelmann density by a function $f(\alpha)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/38.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_38` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such a $B$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
