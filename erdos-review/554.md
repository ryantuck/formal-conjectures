# Review of Erdos Problem 554

## Problem Statement
Let $R_k(G)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $k$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. Show that
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\frac{R_k(C_{2n+1})}{R_k(K_3)}=0$$
for any $n\geq 2$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `odd_cycle_triangle_ratio_vanishes` as `True`.

```lean
theorem odd_cycle_triangle_ratio_vanishes (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) :
    True := by
  trivial
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R_k(G)$ is not defined.
- The limit behavior is not expressed.
