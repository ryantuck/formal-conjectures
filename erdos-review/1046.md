# Erdős Problem 1046 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a monic polynomial and $E=\{ z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}$. If $E$ is connected then is $E$ contained in a disc of radius $2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1046.lean`.

The theorem `disc_containment` states that if the level set is connected, then there exists a center $c$ such that the level set is contained in the closed disc of radius 2 around $c$.
This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
