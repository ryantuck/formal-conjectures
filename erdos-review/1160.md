# Review: Erdos Problem 1160

**Status:** OPEN

## Original Problem

Let $g(n)$ denote the number of groups (up to isomorphism) of order $n$ (OEIS A000001).

**Conjecture:** If $n \leq 2^m$ then $g(n) \leq g(2^m)$.

**Stronger variant (Question 22.18):** For sufficiently large $m$, $\sum_{n < 2^m} g(n) \leq g(2^m)$.

Pantelidakis proved the conjecture holds when $n$ is odd and $m \geq 3619$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem group_order_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ (n m : ℕ), n ≤ 2^m → g n ≤ g (2^m) := by
  sorry

theorem group_order_sum_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ) (M : ℕ), ∀ m ≥ M,
        (Finset.range (2^m)).sum g ≤ g (2^m) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry) ↔` for open problems |
| Inequality structure | Yes | `g n ≤ g (2^m)` |
| Bound condition | Yes | `n ≤ 2^m` |
| Stronger variant with threshold | Yes | `∃ M, ∀ m ≥ M` |
| Sum formulation | Yes | `(Finset.range (2^m)).sum g` |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 20]` (Group theory) |

### Critical issues

1. **Trivially true — both theorems (Critical):** The `∃ (g : ℕ → ℕ)` makes both statements trivially satisfiable. For the first, take `g = fun _ => 0`. For the second, take `g = fun _ => 0` and `M = 0`. The existential quantifies over an arbitrary function, not the specific group-counting function.

2. **g(n) is a specific function, not existentially quantified:** The entire substance of the conjecture is about the *particular* function $g(n) = $ number of groups of order $n$. This is a well-defined, computable function (OEIS A000001). The formalization treats it as an unknown variable.

3. **Defining g(n) in Lean is feasible in principle:** Mathlib has `Fintype` instances for types of group homomorphisms, and one could define `g(n)` as the number of `MulEquiv`-classes of groups whose `Fintype` has cardinality $n$. This would be nontrivial infrastructure but not impossible.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 10%**

Both statements are trivially true. The conjecture is about a specific, well-defined function $g(n)$, but the formalization existentially quantifies over arbitrary functions. The inequality structure and the distinction between the two variants are correctly captured in form but not in substance.
