# Erdős Problem 988 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that $\min_{\lvert Pvert=n}D(P)	o \infty$ as $n	o \infty$, where $D(P)$ is the discrepancy on the unit sphere?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/988.lean`.

The theorem `sphere_discrepancy_unbounded` quantifies over **all** functions `disc : Finset ... -> ℝ`.
It asserts that for any such function, the minimum over sets of size $n$ goes to infinity.
This is trivially false (e.g. `disc P = 0`).
It fails to define the specific discrepancy function `D(P)` mentioned in the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
