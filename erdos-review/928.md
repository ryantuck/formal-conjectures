# Erdős Problem 928 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $\alpha,\beta\in (0,1)$ and let $P(n)$ denote the largest prime divisor of $n$. Does the density of integers $n$ such that $P(n)<n^{\alpha}$ and $P(n+1)<(n+1)^\beta$ exist?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/928.lean`.

The formalization defines `isSmooth y n` (checking $P(n) \le y$).
The theorem `smooth_consecutive_density` asks for the density of $n$ such that `isSmooth y n` and `isSmooth y (n+1)`.
Here $y$ is a constant, independent of $n$.
The problem requires $P(n) < n^\alpha$, where the bound $n^\alpha$ grows with $n$.
The formalization addresses a different problem (smooth numbers with fixed smoothness bound).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
