# Review of Erdos Problem 646

## Problem Statement
Given distinct primes $p_1, \dots, p_k$, are there infinitely many $n$ where $n!$ is divisible by an even power of each $p_i$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts existence for *all* primes.

```lean
theorem factorial_even_prime_powers :
    ∀ M : ℕ, ∃ n > M, ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime →
      ∃ k : ℕ, (p ^ (2*k)) ∣ factorial n := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is incorrect.
- `∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime` means $n!$ is a perfect square (divisible by even power of *every* prime). This is impossible for $n > 1$.
- The problem restricts the condition to a fixed finite set of primes.

## Confidence
0% (Incorrect statement)
