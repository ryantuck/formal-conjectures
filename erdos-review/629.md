# Review of Erdos Problem 629

## Problem Statement
Determine minimal vertices $n(k)$ for bipartite graph with $\chi_L(G) > k$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines $n(k)$ stub and asks for value.

```lean
noncomputable def n (k : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem min_vertices_list_chromatic ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.

## Confidence
100%
