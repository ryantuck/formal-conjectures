# Erdős Problem 997 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for every $\alpha$, the sequence $\{ \alpha p_n\}$ is not well-distributed?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/997.lean`.

The theorem `prime_not_well_distributed` contains a placeholder (`sorry`) for the prime sequence definition (which is trivial) and a placeholder (`sorry`) for the well-distributed condition itself.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
