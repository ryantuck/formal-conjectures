# Erdős Problem 911 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $\hat{R}(G)$ denote the size Ramsey number. Is there a function $f$ such that $f(x)/x	o \infty$ as $x	o \infty$ such that, for all large $C$, if $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and $e\geq Cn$ edges then $\hat{R}(G) > f(C) e$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/911.lean`.

The function `sizeRamsey` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem statement correctly captures the asymptotic growth condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete due to `sizeRamsey`.
