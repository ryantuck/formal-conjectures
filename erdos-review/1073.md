# Erdős Problem 1073 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A(x)$ count the number of composite $u < x$ such that $n!+1\equiv 0\pmod{u}$ for some $n$. Is it true that $A(x)\leq x^{o(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1073.lean`.

The counting function $A(x)$ is correctly defined.
The bound $A(x) \le x^{o(1)}$ is correctly formalized as `∃ (o : ℕ → ℝ), o =o[atTop] (1 : ℕ → ℝ) ∧ ∀ x, A x ≤ x ^ (o x)`.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
