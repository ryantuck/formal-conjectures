## Original Problem

Is it consistent that $\omega_2 \to (\alpha)_2^2$ for every $\alpha < \omega_2$?

This asks whether there exists a model of ZFC in which the second uncountable cardinal $\omega_2$ has the Ramsey-theoretic property that every 2-coloring of pairs from $\omega_2$ contains a monochromatic subset of order type $\alpha$, for every ordinal $\alpha < \omega_2$.

Known results: Laver (1982) proved the consistency of $\omega_2 \to (\omega_1+1, \alpha)^2$ for all $\alpha < \omega_2$. Foreman and Hajnal (2003) proved the consistency of $\omega_2 \to (\omega_1^2+1, \alpha)^2$ for all $\alpha < \omega_2$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
def PartitionRelation (α : Type*) (r : ℕ) (gamma : Type*) (targets : gamma → Type*) : Prop :=
  ∀ (coloring : Finset α → gamma),
    ∃ (color : gamma) (H : Set α),
      (∃ (f : targets color → α), Function.Injective f ∧ Set.range f ⊆ H) ∧
      ∀ (s : Finset α), s.card = r → (↑s : Set α) ⊆ H → coloring s = color

theorem partition_omega_two_consistency :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (alpha_type : Type*) (omega_two_type : Type*) [Infinite omega_two_type],
        PartitionRelation omega_two_type 2 (Fin 2) (fun _ => alpha_type) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry) ↔` is correct for a consistency question |
| 2-coloring of pairs | Partially | PartitionRelation with r=2 and Fin 2 colors |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 03]` is correct |

### Critical issues

1. **Consistency not captured (Critical):** The original asks "Is it *consistent* that...?" — whether there exists a model of ZFC where the partition relation holds. The formalization asserts the partition relation holds outright (in all models), which is a much stronger and likely false claim. Consistency is a metamathematical property that cannot be straightforwardly expressed in Lean's type theory.

2. **No cardinality constraint on α (Critical):** The original says "for every $\alpha < \omega_2$", meaning α ranges over ordinals strictly less than ω₂. The formalization uses `∀ (alpha_type : Type*)` — completely unconstrained. Since alpha_type could be arbitrarily large, the statement demands monochromatic subsets of every possible cardinality, which is far stronger than the original.

3. **No cardinality constraint on ω₂:** `omega_two_type` only requires `[Infinite omega_two_type]`. There is no constraint that this type has cardinality ℵ₂ specifically.

4. **PartitionRelation colors all finsets:** The definition `∀ (coloring : Finset α → gamma)` assigns a color to every finset, not just pairs. While the monochromatic conclusion restricts to `s.card = r`, the universality is over all finset colorings rather than just colorings of r-element subsets. This is equivalent in content (a coloring of all finsets restricts to a coloring of pairs), but is non-standard.

5. **Homogeneous partition relation:** The formalization uses `fun _ => alpha_type`, meaning both colors require a monochromatic set of the same cardinality. The original notation $(α)_2^2$ indeed means both colors get the same target α, so this aspect is correct.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 15%**

The formalization has the right general shape (partition relation, 2 colors, pairs) but misses the core aspect of the problem — consistency — and lacks all cardinality constraints. The universal quantification over unconstrained types makes the statement much stronger than intended.
