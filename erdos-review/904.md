# Erdős Problem 904 Review

## Problem Statement

If $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and $>n^2/4$ edges then it contains a triangle on $x,y,z$ such that $d(x)+d(y)+d(z) \geq \frac{3}{2}n$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/904.lean`.

The theorem `triangle_large_degree_sum` correctly captures the edge condition and the existence of a triangle with the specified degree sum lower bound.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
