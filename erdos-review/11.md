# Erdős Problem 11 Review

## Problem Statement

Is every odd $n > 1$ the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/11.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_11` asks if for every odd $n > 1$, there exist $k, l$ such that $k$ is squarefree and $n = k + 2^l$. This matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
