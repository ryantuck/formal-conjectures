# Erdős Problem 1016 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $h(n)$ be minimal such that there is a graph on $n$ vertices with $n+h(n)$ edges which contains a cycle on $k$ vertices, for all $3\leq k\leq n$. Estimate $h(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1016.lean`.

The function `h` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
