# Review of Erdos Problem 635

## Problem Statement
$A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ such that $a,b \in A, b-a \ge t \implies b-a \nmid b$. How large can $|A|$ be?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for a bound.

```lean
noncomputable def f (constraints : Set (ℕ × ℕ)) : ℕ := sorry
theorem divisibility_constraint_bound :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ A : Finset ℕ, sorry → A.card ≤ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton. The divisibility condition is not explicit in the code (hidden in `sorry` or `constraints`).
Also `f` is defined generally but the theorem is specific to "divisibility constraint bound".
Without the specific condition $b-a \nmid b$, it's just a general statement about "some constraint".
