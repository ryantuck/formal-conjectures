# Erdős Problem 1031 Review

## Problem Statement

If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices which contains no trivial (empty or complete) subgraph on $\geq 10\log n$ many vertices, then must $G$ contain an induced non-trivial regular subgraph on $\gg \log n$ many vertices?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1031.lean`.

The formalization uses `H ≤ G` which typically denotes that $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ (subset of vertices, subset of edges). The problem explicitly asks for an *induced* subgraph.
By allowing arbitrary subgraphs, the regular subgraph property is much easier to satisfy (one can delete edges to make it regular).
Therefore, the formalization is weaker than the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect (missing "induced" condition).
