# Review: Erdos Problem 1125

**Problem:** Midpoint convexity implies monotonicity
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1125](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1125)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Let f : R -> R satisfy 2f(x) <= f(x+h) + f(x+2h) for every x in R and h > 0. Must f be monotonic?

Kemperman proved this when f is measurable. The general case (without measurability) was established by Laczkovich (1984).

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 26]
theorem convexity_monotonicity :
    ∀ (f : ℝ → ℝ), ConvexOn ℝ (Set.Ici 0) f →
      Monotone f →
      (∀ x ≥ 0, f x ≥ f 0) ∧ -- Follows from monotonicity
      True := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Statement assumes the conclusion (CRITICAL)

The source asks: "Does the inequality condition IMPLY monotonicity?" The formalization ASSUMES monotonicity (Monotone f) as a hypothesis and then concludes a trivial consequence. This completely reverses the logical structure of the problem.

### 2. Wrong hypothesis (CRITICAL)

The source hypothesis is the specific inequality: 2f(x) <= f(x+h) + f(x+2h) for all x and h > 0. The formalization uses ConvexOn R (Set.Ici 0) f, which is Mathlib's standard convexity (f(tx + (1-t)y) <= tf(x) + (1-t)f(y) for t in [0,1]). While the source condition is related to a form of convexity, it is not the same as ConvexOn restricted to [0, infinity). The source condition applies to ALL x in R, not just x >= 0.

### 3. Conclusion is trivial and wrong (CRITICAL)

The conclusion `(∀ x ≥ 0, f x ≥ f 0) ∧ True` is:
- A trivial consequence of the assumed `Monotone f` (if f is monotone increasing and x >= 0, then f(x) >= f(0))
- Padded with `True`
- Not what the problem asks for at all

The problem's conclusion should be: f is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing).

### 4. Domain restriction is wrong (MODERATE)

The source problem is about functions on all of R with the inequality holding for all x in R and h > 0. The formalization restricts to Set.Ici 0 (the non-negative reals).

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 26]
theorem convexity_monotonicity :
    ∀ (f : ℝ → ℝ),
      (∀ x : ℝ, ∀ h : ℝ, 0 < h → 2 * f x ≤ f (x + h) + f (x + 2 * h)) →
      Monotone f ∨ Antitone f := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization assumes the conclusion (monotonicity) as a hypothesis and then deduces a trivial consequence. The actual hypothesis (the specific inequality 2f(x) <= f(x+h) + f(x+2h)) is absent, replaced by standard convexity on a restricted domain. The statement as written is both trivially provable and mathematically unrelated to the source problem.
