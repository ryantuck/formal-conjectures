# Review: Erdos Problem 1125

**Problem:** Convexity-like inequality implies monotonicity
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1125](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1125)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Let f : R -> R satisfy 2f(x) <= f(x+h) + f(x+2h) for every x in R and h > 0. Must f be monotonic?

Kemperman proved this when f is measurable. Laczkovich (1984) established the general case without measurability.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 26]
theorem convexity_monotonicity :
    ∀ (f : ℝ → ℝ),
      (∀ x : ℝ, ∀ h : ℝ, 0 < h → 2 * f x ≤ f (x + h) + f (x + 2 * h)) →
      Monotone f ∨ Antitone f := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Correct hypothesis (POSITIVE)

The hypothesis `∀ x : ℝ, ∀ h : ℝ, 0 < h → 2 * f x ≤ f (x + h) + f (x + 2 * h)` exactly matches the source condition: 2f(x) <= f(x+h) + f(x+2h) for every x in R and h > 0. Every quantifier and inequality is correct.

### 2. Correct conclusion (POSITIVE)

`Monotone f ∨ Antitone f` correctly states that f must be either non-decreasing or non-increasing. "Monotonic" in the source means either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing, which is exactly what `Monotone f ∨ Antitone f` captures.

### 3. Correct domain (POSITIVE)

`f : ℝ → ℝ` with quantification over all `x : ℝ` correctly uses the entire real line, matching the source.

### 4. No unnecessary assumptions (POSITIVE)

The formalization does not assume measurability, continuity, or any regularity of f. This matches the general result of Laczkovich (1984), which proves monotonicity without any additional assumptions on f.

### 5. No answer elaborator (POSITIVE)

Since this is a solved/proved problem with a definite result, the formalization correctly states the theorem directly without `answer(sorry) ↔ ...`.

### 6. Category tag is correct (POSITIVE)

`@[category research solved, AMS 26]` correctly marks this as solved, with AMS classification 26 (real functions).

### 7. Strict inequality h > 0 (POSITIVE)

The condition `0 < h` correctly restricts h to be strictly positive, matching the source's "h > 0." If h = 0 were allowed, the inequality would become 2f(x) <= 2f(x), which is always true and adds no information.

## What a proper formalization would look like

The current formalization is exactly correct. No changes needed.

```lean
-- The current formalization is correct as-is.
-- No changes needed.
```

## Confidence: **98%**

This is an essentially perfect formalization. The hypothesis, conclusion, quantifier structure, domain, and absence of unnecessary assumptions all exactly match the source problem. The only reason to withhold 2% is the theoretical possibility of a subtle Lean type-checking issue (e.g., whether `2 * f x` vs `f x + f x` matters, or edge cases in Mathlib's `Monotone`/`Antitone` definitions), but these are extremely unlikely to be problems. This is a clean, correct formalization.
