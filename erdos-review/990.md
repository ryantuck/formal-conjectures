# Erdős Problem 990 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f=a_0+\cdots+a_dx^d\in \mathbb{C}[x]$. Is it true that the roots' arguments are equidistributed with error $\ll (n\log M)^{1/2}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/990.lean`.

The formalization quantifies `∀ (P : ℂ[X]) (n M : ℕ)`.
It defines `n` (as `nonzero_coeffs`) correctly in terms of `P`.
However, `M` is treated as a free variable `∀ M`. The theorem asks "For all polynomials P and all integers M, does the bound hold?".
Since `M` appears in the bound `sqrt(n * log M)`, one can choose `M` arbitrarily large to make the bound trivial.
The quantity $M$ is defined in the problem as the Mahler measure (or similar norm) of $f$. It should be computed from $P$, not quantified over.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
