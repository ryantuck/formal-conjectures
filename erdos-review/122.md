# Erdős Problem 122 Review

## Problem Statement

Shifted distribution property for arithmetic functions.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/122.lean`.

The definition `erdos_122` asks for a characterization. This is a bit abstract but captures the "problem" nature.

## Completeness

The formalization defines the property but leaves the characterization open. Valid for a problem.

## Confidence

100%
