# Erdős Problem 1041 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\in \mathbb{C}[z]$ with $\lvert z_ivert < 1$ for all $i$. Must there always exist a path of length less than $2$ in $\{z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}$ which connects two of the roots of $f$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1041.lean`.

The formalization `erdos_1041` asserts the existence of a path $\gamma$ between two roots $z_1, z_2$ such that the path is contained in the level set and has length $< 2$.
This perfectly matches the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
