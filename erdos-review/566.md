# Review of Erdos Problem 566

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be such that any subgraph on $k$ vertices has at most $2k-3$ edges. Is it true that if $H$ has $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, then $\hat{R}(G,H) \ll m$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines the sparse condition and the size Ramsey linearity condition.

## Critique
The formalization captures the problem exactly.
- The sparse condition `at most 2k-3 edges` is correctly formalized.
- The conclusion `sizeRamsey G H ≤ c * m` matches $\hat{R}(G,H) \ll m$ (linear in $m$).
- `sizeRamsey` is used, matching $\hat{R}$.
