# Erdős Problem 1057 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $C(x)$ count the number of Carmichael numbers in the interval $[1,x]$. Is it true that $C(x)=x^{1-o(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1057.lean`.

The formalization `carmichael_growth` posits the existence of a sequence $C_n$ of Carmichael numbers such that $C_{n+1}/C_n 	o 1$.
This implies a certain density of Carmichael numbers, but it is not equivalent to the specific counting function bound $C(x) = x^{1-o(1)}$.
The problem is about the *global count* $C(x)$, whereas the formalization is about the *local gaps* of some subsequence.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect (does not match the specific asymptotic claim).

## Confidence
