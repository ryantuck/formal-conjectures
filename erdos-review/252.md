# Erdős Problem 252 Review

## Problem Statement

Is $\sum \frac{\sigma(n)}{n!}$ irrational?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/252.lean`.

The theorems `erdos_252_0` through `_4` prove specific cases. `erdos_252_ge_5` asks if it holds for all $k \ge 5$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proofs, but the statements are complete.

## Confidence

100%
