# Erdős Problem 253 Review

## Problem Statement

Completeness of sequence with $a_{i+1}/a_i \to 1$ representing large APs.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/253.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_253` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to completeness (negation of non-completeness). Wait, the theorem statement is `¬ ...`. If the answer is "no", then `¬` means it's false that it implies completeness. Erdős conjectured "yes".
The theorem statement says `¬ (∀ a ... → is_complete a)`. This means "It is not true that for all a ..., a is complete".
The problem asks "If ... then every sufficiently large integer is the sum...".
So the conjecture is `∀ a ... → is_complete a`.
The formalization asserts the negation. The `answer` tag isn't used here, just a direct theorem statement.
Assuming the formalization intends to state the negation as a theorem (disproof of conjecture), it's valid.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
