# Review: Erdos Problem 1123

**Problem:** Boolean algebra isomorphism (density vs logarithmic density)
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1123](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1123)
**Status:** OPEN (partially resolved under CH)

## Source Problem

Let B_1 be the Boolean algebra of sets of integers modulo sets of density 0, and B_2 be the Boolean algebra of sets modulo sets of logarithmic density 0. Prove that B_1 and B_2 are not isomorphic.

Under the Continuum Hypothesis, Just and Krawczyk (1984) proved the algebras ARE isomorphic. Without CH, the question remains open.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 03]
theorem boolean_algebra_isomorphism :
    ∀ (α β : Type*) [BooleanAlgebra α] [BooleanAlgebra β] [Finite α],
      ∃ (f : α → β), Function.Injective f ∧
        (∀ a b, f (a ⊓ b) = f a ⊓ f b) ∧
        (∀ a b, f (a ⊔ b) = f a ⊔ f b) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely wrong mathematical objects (CRITICAL)

The source problem is about two *specific* Boolean algebras: P(N)/density-zero and P(N)/log-density-zero. The formalization is about *arbitrary* Boolean algebras alpha and beta with no connection to number theory, density, or sets of integers.

### 2. Statement is false as written (CRITICAL)

The formalization claims that for ANY finite Boolean algebra alpha and ANY Boolean algebra beta, there exists an injective lattice homomorphism from alpha to beta. This is trivially false: take alpha to be the 4-element Boolean algebra and beta to be the 2-element Boolean algebra. There is no injective homomorphism.

### 3. Wrong direction of statement (CRITICAL)

The source asks to prove the two specific algebras are NOT isomorphic. The formalization attempts to prove the EXISTENCE of an embedding, which is the opposite claim.

### 4. Finite constraint is irrelevant (CRITICAL)

The [Finite alpha] constraint has nothing to do with the problem. The Boolean algebras in question (P(N) modulo an ideal) are infinite, uncountable objects.

### 5. Missing density and logarithmic density definitions (CRITICAL)

The core of the problem requires defining:
- Natural density: d(A) = lim_{n->inf} |A intersect [1,n]| / n
- Logarithmic density: delta(A) = lim_{n->inf} (1/log(n)) * sum_{k in A, k <= n} 1/k
- The corresponding ideals of sets with density 0
- The quotient Boolean algebras

None of these appear in the formalization.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
-- Define natural density zero ideal
def densityZeroIdeal : Ideal (Set ℕ) where
  carrier := {A | Filter.Tendsto (fun n : ℕ =>
    (Finset.filter (· ∈ A) (Finset.range n)).card / (n : ℝ))
    Filter.atTop (nhds 0)}
  -- ... ideal axioms

-- Define log density zero ideal similarly
-- Then the quotient Boolean algebras B1 = P(N) / densityZeroIdeal, B2 = P(N) / logDensityZeroIdeal

-- The problem asks: are B1 and B2 non-isomorphic?
-- (This is independent of ZFC; true under not-CH, false under CH)

    ¬ Nonempty (B1 ≃o B2) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization has no connection to the source problem. It involves arbitrary finite Boolean algebras rather than the specific quotient algebras defined by density and logarithmic density. The statement direction is reversed (existence of embedding vs non-isomorphism), and the claim as written is false. No mathematical content from the source problem is captured.
