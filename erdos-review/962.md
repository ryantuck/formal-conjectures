# Erdős Problem 962 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k(n)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exists $m\leq n$ such that each of the integers $m+1,\ldots,m+k$ are divisible by at least one prime $>k$. Estimate $k(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/962.lean`.

The function `k(n)` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem `divisibility_sequence_length` depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
