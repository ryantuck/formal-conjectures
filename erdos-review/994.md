# Erdős Problem 994 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $E\subseteq (0,1)$ be a meaurable subset. Is it true that, for almost all $\alpha$, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}1_{\{k\alpha \}\in E} 	o \lambda(E)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/994.lean`.

The theorem `not_all_measurable_equidistribution` asserts the negation of the conjecture.
It quantifies over $\alpha$ and $E$, asserting there is a failure of convergence.
The problem asks if it holds for *all* $E$ (for almost all $\alpha$ fixed first? Or fixed E, almost all alpha?).
The problem says: "for almost all $\alpha$, ... for all $E$".
Formalization: `¬ ∀ α ... ∀ E ... Tendsto`.
This matches the structure (negating "for almost all $\alpha$, for all E").

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
