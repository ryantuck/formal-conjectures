# Erdős Problem 901 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $m(n)$ be minimal such that there is an $n$-uniform hypergraph with $m(n)$ edges which is $3$-chromatic. Estimate $m(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/901.lean`.

The function `chromaticNumber` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The definition of `m(n)` relies on this placeholder.
The file contains several theorems (`exact_values`, `erdos_bounds`, etc.) that formalize known bounds and conjectures. These are well-structured, but ultimately depend on the undefined chromatic number.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete due to the undefined `chromaticNumber`.

## Confidence
