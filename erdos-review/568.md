# Review of Erdos Problem 568

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a graph such that $R(G, T_n) \ll n$ for any tree $T_n$ and $R(G, K_n) \ll n^2$. Is it true that $R(G, H) \ll m$ for any $H$ with $m$ edges?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines a `ramseyNumber` stub and the conjecture.

```lean
def ramseyNumber (G : SimpleGraph α) (H : SimpleGraph β) : ℕ := sorry

theorem ramsey_size_linearity ...
```

## Critique
The formalization logic seems correct, *assuming* `ramseyNumber` refers to the **size Ramsey number** ($\hat{R}$ or $\hat{r}$).
- The problem discusses "Ramsey size linearity" and bounds in terms of edges ($m$).
- The Lean file defines a local `ramseyNumber` as `sorry`.
- `ramseyNumber` usually denotes the vertex Ramsey number $R(G,H)$.
- Ideally, this should use `sizeRamsey` (as seen in Problem 566) or be explicitly named `sizeRamseyNumber`.
- If `ramseyNumber` is interpreted as size Ramsey number, the statement is 100% correct. If it is interpreted as vertex Ramsey number, it is likely incorrect or nonsensical in this context. Given the problem title "Ramsey size linearity", the intent is clear, but the naming is ambiguous.

## Confidence
90% (deducted for naming ambiguity)
