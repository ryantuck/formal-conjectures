# Review of Erdos Problem 636

## Problem Statement
Graphs with no large cliques/independent sets contain $\gg n^{5/2}$ induced subgraphs which pairwise differ in either the number of vertices or the number of edges.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts a lower bound on `sorry`.

```lean
theorem small_clique_independent_many_induced ...
        sorry ≥ c * (n : ℝ) ^ (5/2)
```

## Critique
The quantity being bounded (`sorry`) needs to be the number of distinct pairs $(v, e)$ such that there is an induced subgraph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges.
The formalization treats it as a single scalar. If the definition of `sorry` (or whatever fills it) is correct, it's fine, but the *condition* "differ in vertices or edges" is not explicit in the theorem statement.
Usually "many induced subgraphs" means many non-isomorphic ones, or many distinct vertex sets. The specific condition "differ in v or e" is very specific and much stronger.
The current formalization is a placeholder.
