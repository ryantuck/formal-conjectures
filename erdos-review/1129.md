# Review: Erdos Problem 1129

**Problem:** Minimizing the Lebesgue constant for Lagrange interpolation
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1129](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1129)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Given points x_1, ..., x_n in [-1,1], define the Lagrange basis polynomials l_k(x) = prod_{i != k} (x - x_i) / prod_{i != k} (x_k - x_i). The Lebesgue constant is Lambda(x_1,...,x_n) = max_{x in [-1,1]} sum_k |l_k(x)|.

Which choice of x_i minimizes Lambda? Erdos showed Lambda > (2/pi) log(n) - O(1) for all choices. Chebyshev roots achieve Lambda < (2/pi) log(n) + O(1). De Boor and Pinkus proved uniqueness of the minimizer. Kilgore proved minimization occurs when all local Lebesgue constants are equal.

## Current Formalization

```lean
noncomputable def Λ {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry

@[category research solved, AMS 41]
theorem lebesgue_constant_minimum (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ (x : Fin n → ℝ),
      (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) ∧
      ∀ (y : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, y i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        Λ x ≤ Λ y := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Lambda is undefined (CRITICAL)

The Lebesgue constant `Λ` is defined as `sorry`, meaning it has no actual definition. The theorem statement refers to a function with no mathematical content. Any proof or analysis is meaningless without knowing what Λ computes.

### 2. Correct high-level structure (POSITIVE)

Assuming Λ were properly defined, the statement correctly asserts: there exist points in [-1,1] that minimize the Lebesgue constant over all choices of points in [-1,1]. This is indeed part of what was proved (De Boor and Pinkus showed existence and uniqueness).

### 3. Missing Λ definition (CRITICAL)

The Lebesgue constant should be defined as:
```
Λ(x) = sup_{t ∈ [-1,1]} Σ_k |l_k(t)|
```
where l_k(t) = Π_{i≠k} (t - x_i) / Π_{i≠k} (x_k - x_i). This requires defining Lagrange basis polynomials, which is non-trivial but important.

### 4. Missing logarithmic growth bound (MODERATE)

A key part of the problem is Erdos's result that Λ > (2/π) log(n) - O(1). The formalization only addresses existence of a minimizer, not the growth rate. While the existence of a minimizer is a valid solved subproblem, the asymptotic bounds are also important results.

### 5. Missing uniqueness (MINOR)

De Boor and Pinkus proved the minimizer is unique. The formalization only asserts existence, not uniqueness.

### 6. Distinctness of points not required (MINOR)

Lagrange interpolation requires distinct nodes. The formalization does not require the points x to be pairwise distinct. With repeated points, the Lagrange basis functions have division by zero, making Λ undefined (or infinite).

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
noncomputable def lagrangeBasis {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) (k : Fin n) : Polynomial ℝ :=
  ∏ i in Finset.univ.filter (· ≠ k),
    Polynomial.C (1 / (x k - x i)) * (Polynomial.X - Polynomial.C (x i))

noncomputable def lebesgueConstant {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ⨆ t ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, ∑ k, |Polynomial.eval t (lagrangeBasis x k)|

@[category research solved, AMS 41]
theorem lebesgue_constant_minimum (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
    ∃ (x : Fin n → ℝ),
      (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) ∧
      (Function.Injective x) ∧
      ∀ (y : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, y i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        Function.Injective y →
        lebesgueConstant x ≤ lebesgueConstant y := by
  sorry

-- Additionally, the logarithmic growth:
theorem lebesgue_constant_lower_bound :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) (x : Fin n → ℝ),
      (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) → Function.Injective x →
      lebesgueConstant x > (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n - C := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **25%**

The theorem statement has the right logical shape (existence of a minimizer for a function over points in [-1,1]), and the constraint that points lie in [-1,1] is correct. However, the Lebesgue constant itself is completely undefined (sorry), making the statement vacuous in practice. The missing distinctness condition and missing asymptotic bounds further reduce confidence. The core mathematical content is recognizable but unimplemented.
