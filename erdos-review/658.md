# Review of Erdos Problem 658

## Problem Statement
Dense subset of grid ($|A| \ge \delta N^2$) contains square?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts this.

```lean
theorem dense_grid_contains_square ...
        ∃ a d : ℕ, d > 0 ∧
          (a, a) ∈ A ∧ (a+d, a) ∈ A ∧ (a, a+d) ∈ A ∧ (a+d, a+d) ∈ A
```

## Critique
The formalization checks for an *axis-aligned* square `(a,a), (a+d,a), (a,a+d), (a+d,a+d)`.
The problem statement just says "vertices of a square" (could be tilted).
However, "Solymosi (2004)" and "density Hales-Jewett" context usually refers to axis-aligned squares or squares in general. If tilted squares are allowed, the condition is weaker.
Usually in grid problems like Szemeredi's theorem generalizations, "square" means axis-aligned unless specified.
But looking at the reference (Solymosi 2004 "Note on a theorem of Erdős and Turán"), it often deals with isosceles right triangles or general squares.
Given it's a grid problem, axis-aligned is the standard interpretation for the "density Hales-Jewett" type result.
But if it meant *any* square, the theorem is stronger. The formalization proves the axis-aligned case.
I'll assume axis-aligned is the intended meaning or a sufficient subcase.

## Confidence
90% (Axis-aligned assumption)
