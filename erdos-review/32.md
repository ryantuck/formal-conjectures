# Erdős Problem 32 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $|A \cap \{1, \dots, N\}| = o((\log N)^2)$ and $A$ is an additive complement to the primes?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/32.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_32` asks if `answer(True)` corresponds to the existence of such a set with $O(\log N)$ growth. This matches the known result.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
