# Erdős Problem 60 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $>\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)$ edges contain $\gg n^{1/2}$ copies of $C_4$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/60.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_60` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
