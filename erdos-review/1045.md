# Erdős Problem 1045 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert z_i-z_jvert\leq 2$ for all $i,j$. What is the maximum possible value of the product of pairwise distances $\Delta$? Is it maximised by the regular polygon?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1045.lean`.

The product $\Delta$ is correctly defined.
The theorem `max_product_distances` merely asserts the existence of *some* upper bound $M$. It does not ask for the *maximum* possible value, nor does it ask if the regular polygon achieves it.
The formalization is very weak compared to the specific questions in the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete/weak.
