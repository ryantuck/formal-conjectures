# Review: Erdos Problem 1122

**Problem:** Additive functions with few reversals must be c*log(n)
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1122](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1122)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let f : N -> R be an additive function (f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1). Define A = {n >= 1 : f(n+1) < f(n)}. If |A intersect [1,X]| = o(X), must f(n) = c*log(n) for some constant c?

Erdos established that f(n) = c*log(n) when A is empty or when f(n+1) - f(n) = o(1).

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem additive_function_monotonicity :
    ∀ (f : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ m n, f (m + n) = f m + f n) →
      (∀ n, f n > 0) → -- Non-trivial additive function
      Monotone f → -- Monotonicity constraint
      ∃ (k : ℕ), 0 < k ∧ ∀ n, f n ≤ k * n := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Wrong notion of additivity (CRITICAL)

The source problem uses *multiplicatively additive* functions: f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1. The formalization uses *Cauchy additivity*: f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) for ALL m, n (no coprimality condition). These are completely different classes of functions. Cauchy-additive functions on N satisfy f(n) = n * f(1), making the statement trivial.

### 2. Wrong codomain (CRITICAL)

The source has f : N -> R (real-valued). The formalization uses f : N -> N (natural-number-valued). This eliminates the possibility of f(n) = c*log(n) for non-integer c, which is the very conclusion the problem asks about.

### 3. Wrong question entirely (CRITICAL)

The source asks: "If the set where f decreases has density zero, must f be a constant multiple of log?" The formalization instead asks: "If f is (fully) monotone, must f be linearly bounded?" These are entirely different mathematical questions.

### 4. Missing density condition (CRITICAL)

The key hypothesis is that |{n <= X : f(n+1) < f(n)}| = o(X), meaning "almost always non-decreasing." The formalization replaces this with full monotonicity (Monotone f), which is a much stronger assumption.

### 5. Wrong conclusion (CRITICAL)

The source concludes f(n) = c*log(n) for some constant c. The formalization concludes f(n) <= k*n for some k, which is a linear growth bound. These have nothing to do with each other.

### 6. Should use answer(sorry) for open problem

Since this is an open yes/no question ("must f be c*log(n)?"), the formalization should use the `answer(sorry) <-> ...` pattern.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem additive_function_monotonicity :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (f : ℕ → ℝ),
        (∀ a b, Nat.Coprime a b → f (a * b) = f a + f b) →
        (Filter.Tendsto (fun X : ℕ =>
          (Finset.filter (fun n => f (n + 1) < f n) (Finset.range X)).card / (X : ℝ))
          Filter.atTop (nhds 0)) →
        ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ n > 0, f n = c * Real.log n := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

Every aspect of the formalization is wrong: the notion of additivity, the codomain, the hypothesis, and the conclusion. The mathematical question being asked bears no resemblance to the source problem. This appears to be a generic statement about Cauchy-additive functions on N rather than the actual Erdos problem about multiplicatively additive functions with rare decreases.
