# Review: Erdos Problem 1117

**Problem:** Maximum modulus points on circles for entire functions
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1117](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1117)
**Status:** OPEN (first question answered affirmatively; second question remains open)

## Source Problem

Let f(z) be an entire function that is not a monomial. Define nu(r) as the number of points z with |z| = r where |f(z)| = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)| (this is finite for non-monomials).

Two questions:
1. Is it possible for lim sup nu(r) = infinity? (Yes, by Herzog and Piranian, 1968)
2. Is it possible for lim inf nu(r) = infinity? (Open)

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem entire_functions_circle_maxima :
    ∀ (f : ℂ → ℂ) (r : ℝ), 0 < r →
      ∃ (z : ℂ), ‖z‖ = r ∧
        (∀ w : ℂ, ‖w‖ = r → ‖f z‖ ≥ ‖f w‖) ∧ -- z is a maximum on the circle
        True := by -- Additional property about such maxima
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. States a trivial fact, not the actual problem (CRITICAL)

The formalization says: for every function f and radius r > 0, there exists a point z on the circle of radius r that achieves the maximum of |f| on that circle. This is just the extreme value theorem applied to continuous functions on compact sets (the circle is compact). It is trivially true for any continuous function, not just entire functions.

The actual problem asks about how MANY such maximum points there are (the count nu(r)), and whether lim inf nu(r) can be infinity.

### 2. Missing nu(r) - the count of maximum points (CRITICAL)

The source problem defines nu(r) as the number of points achieving the maximum modulus on |z| = r. The formalization merely asserts one such point exists, never counting them.

### 3. Missing the "not a monomial" condition (CRITICAL)

The source requires f to not be a monomial (since for monomials f(z) = c*z^n, every point on the circle achieves the maximum, giving nu(r) = infinity trivially). The formalization has no such restriction.

### 4. Missing the lim inf question (CRITICAL)

The open question is whether lim inf nu(r) = infinity is possible. The formalization does not mention limits, lim inf, or lim sup.

### 5. Missing entireness condition (MODERATE)

The source requires f to be an entire function. The formalization uses `f : C -> C` with no analyticity condition.

### 6. The True placeholder (CRITICAL)

The `True` at the end is a placeholder that adds no content. The "additional property about such maxima" is where the actual problem should be, but it is vacuous.

### 7. Wrong quantifier direction (MODERATE)

The formalization quantifies universally over f (for ALL functions), while the open question asks existentially (does there EXIST a non-monomial entire function with lim inf nu(r) = infinity?).

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- Does there exist a non-monomial entire function f such that
    lim inf_{r→∞} ν(r) = ∞, where ν(r) = #{z : |z|=r, |f(z)| = M(r)}? -/
theorem entire_functions_circle_maxima :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), Differentiable ℂ f ∧
        (¬∃ (c : ℂ) (n : ℕ), ∀ z, f z = c * z ^ n) ∧ -- not a monomial
        Filter.Tendsto
          (fun r : ℝ => Nat.card {z : ℂ | ‖z‖ = r ∧
            ‖f z‖ = ⨆ w : {w : ℂ // ‖w‖ = r}, ‖f w‖})
          Filter.atTop Filter.atTop := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

The formalization states a trivial consequence of the extreme value theorem (existence of a maximum on a compact set) rather than the actual problem about counting maximum points and their limiting behavior. The core concepts (nu(r), lim inf, non-monomial condition) are all absent.
