# Review: Erdos Problem 1132

**Problem:** Absolute value sums in Lagrange interpolation
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1132](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1132)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Given x_1, x_2, ... in [-1,1] and Lagrange basis polynomials l_k(x), define L_n(x) = sum_{1 <= k <= n} |l_k(x)| for the first n points.

**Question 1:** Must there exist x in (-1,1) such that L_n(x) > (2/pi) log n - O(1) for infinitely many n?

**Question 2:** Is it true that limsup_{n -> infinity} L_n(x) / log n >= 2/pi for almost all x in (-1,1)?

## Current Formalization

```lean
/-- Sum of absolute values of Lagrange basis functions -/
noncomputable def L {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) (t : ℝ) : ℝ := sorry

/-- Absolute value sums in Lagrange interpolation exceed logarithmic bound. -/

    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ (seq : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)),
      (∀ n i, seq n i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
      ∃ (t : ℝ), t ∈ Set.Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1 ∧
        (∀ᶠ n in atTop, L (seq n) t > (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n - 10) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Good capture of Question 1 structure (MINOR positive)

The formalization captures Question 1 reasonably well: for any sequence of nodes in [-1,1], there exists a point t in (-1,1) where L_n(t) > (2/pi) log n - O(1) for infinitely many (in fact, eventually all) n. The use of `answer(sorry)` is appropriate for an open problem.

### 2. "Eventually" vs "infinitely often" (MODERATE)

The source asks for L_n(x) > (2/pi) log n - O(1) for **infinitely many** n. The formalization uses `∀ᶠ n in atTop`, which means **eventually** (for all sufficiently large n). Eventually is strictly stronger than infinitely often. The correct filter would be `Filter.Frequently` or `∃ᶠ n in atTop` rather than `∀ᶠ n in atTop`.

### 3. Hard-coded constant 10 instead of O(1) (MINOR)

The O(1) bound in the source is replaced by the specific constant 10. This is a reasonable simplification -- if the statement holds for some constant, 10 is as good as any other. However, it would be more faithful to existentially quantify: `∃ (C : ℝ), ∀ᶠ n in atTop, L (seq n) t > (2/pi) * log n - C`.

### 4. Only Question 1 is formalized (MODERATE)

The source contains two questions. Question 2 (about almost all x) is not formalized. While it is acceptable to formalize only one question, the docstring should clarify which question is being addressed.

### 5. Node sequence model is correct (MINOR positive)

The use of `seq : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` to represent a growing sequence of node sets is a reasonable model for the source problem's "given x_1, x_2, ..." (where for n nodes, you use the first n points).

### 6. Definition of L is opaque (MODERATE)

`L` is defined as `sorry`. It should compute `sum_{k} |l_k(t)|` for the Lagrange basis at nodes x.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem lagrange_absolute_value_sums :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ (seq : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)),
      (∀ n i, seq n i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
      ∃ (t : ℝ), t ∈ Set.Ioo (-1 : ℝ) 1 ∧
        ∃ (C : ℝ), ∃ᶠ n in atTop,
          L (seq n) t > (2 / Real.pi) * Real.log n - C := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **50%**

The formalization captures the spirit of Question 1 with correct quantifier structure (for all node sequences, exists a point where the bound is exceeded). The main issues are: (1) `∀ᶠ` (eventually) should be `∃ᶠ` (infinitely often), (2) hard-coded constant 10 instead of existentially quantified O(1), (3) only one of two questions formalized, and (4) opaque sorry definition. The overall mathematical direction is correct.
