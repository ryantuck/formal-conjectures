# Erdős Problem 940 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $r\geq 3$. Does the set of integers which are the sum of at most $r$ $r$-powerful numbers have density $0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/940.lean`.

The definition of $r$-powerful uses `r.Full` (standard Mathlib).
The set is defined as those $n$ which are sums of a multiset $S$ of size $\le r$ of $r$-powerful numbers.
The theorem asks if this set has density 0.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
