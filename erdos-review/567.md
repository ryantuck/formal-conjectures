# Review of Erdos Problem 567

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be either $Q_3$, $K_{3,3}$, or $H_5$. Is it true that $\hat{R}(G,H) \ll m$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines the graphs and asks if they are `IsRamseySizeLinear`.

```lean
theorem erdos_567_Q3 : answer(sorry) ↔ IsRamseySizeLinear Q3 := by sorry
theorem erdos_567_K33 : answer(sorry) ↔ IsRamseySizeLinear K33 := by sorry
theorem erdos_567_H5 : answer(sorry) ↔ IsRamseySizeLinear H5 := by sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization assumes `IsRamseySizeLinear G` is defined elsewhere (or in imports) as $\forall H, \hat{R}(G,H) \le C |E(H)|$. Given the context of the previous problem using `sizeRamsey` explicitly, this abstraction is appropriate.
The definitions of $Q_3$, $K_{3,3}$, and $H_5$ appear correct.
