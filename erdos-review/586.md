# Review of Erdos Problem 586

## Problem Statement
Is there a covering system such that no two of the moduli divide each other?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the non-existence of such a system.

```lean
theorem no_covering_system_nondivisible_moduli :
    ¬ ∃ (S : Finset (ℕ × ℕ)), IsCoveringSystem S ∧
      (∀ (a₁ m₁) (a₂ m₂), ... ¬ (m₁ ∣ m₂) ∧ ¬ (m₂ ∣ m₁)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the problem exactly.
- `IsCoveringSystem` is defined.
- The condition "no two moduli divide each other" is expressed as `¬ (m₁ ∣ m₂) ∧ ¬ (m₂ ∣ m₁)` for distinct pairs.
