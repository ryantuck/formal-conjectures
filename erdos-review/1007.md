# Erdős Problem 1007 Review

## Problem Statement

The dimension of a graph $G$ is the minimal $n$ such that $G$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every edge of $G$ is a unit line segment. What is the smallest number of edges in a graph with dimension $4$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1007.lean`.

The definition of `dimension` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
