# Review of Erdos Problem 620

## Problem Statement
If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices without a $K_4$, how large a triangle-free induced subgraph must $G$ contain?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the bounds on this quantity.

```lean
noncomputable def f (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem f_lower_bound ...
theorem f_upper_bound ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `f` is defined (stub).
- Bounds are transcribed correctly.

## Confidence
100%
