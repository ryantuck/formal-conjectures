# Erdős Problem 929 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $S(k)$ be the minimal $x$ such that there is a positive density set of $n$ where $n+1,\ldots,n+k$ are all divisible by primes $\leq x$. Estimate $S(k)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/929.lean`.

The theorem `prime_factor_gap` addresses `Tendsto ... |P(n) - P(n+1)| ...`.
This concerns the difference in largest prime factors of consecutive integers.
The problem concerns the "local smoothness" bound $S(k)$ for blocks of length $k$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
