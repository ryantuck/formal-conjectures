# Review of Erdos Problem 561

## Problem Statement
Let $F_1 = \bigcup_{i\le s} K_{1,n_i}$ and $F_2 = \bigcup_{j\le t} K_{1,m_j}$ be unions of stars.
Prove $\hat{R}(F_1,F_2) = \sum_{2\le k\le s+t} l_k$ where $l_k = \max\{n_i + m_j - 1 : i+j = k\}$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `size_ramsey_star_unions` as `True`.

```lean
theorem size_ramsey_star_unions (s t : ℕ) (n : Fin s → ℕ) (m : Fin t → ℕ) :
    True := by
  trivial
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(F_1, F_2)$ is not defined.
- The structure of the stars and the summation formula are not expressed.
