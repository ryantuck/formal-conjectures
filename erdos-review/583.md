# Review of Erdos Problem 583

## Problem Statement
Can every connected graph on $n$ vertices be partitioned into at most $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ edge-disjoint paths?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for a partition of edges into paths.

```lean
theorem connected_graph_path_partition (G : SimpleGraph α) (hconn : G.Connected) :
    ∃ (paths : Finset (Finset (α × α))),
      paths.card ≤ (Fintype.card α + 1) / 2 ∧
      (∀ P ∈ paths, ∀ (e : α × α), e ∈ P → G.Adj e.1 e.2) ∧
      (∀ P₁ P₂, P₁ ∈ paths → P₂ ∈ paths → P₁ ≠ P₂ → Disjoint P₁ P₂) ∧
      (∀ v w, G.Adj v w → ∃ P ∈ paths, (v, w) ∈ P ∨ (w, v) ∈ P) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is generally correct.
- `paths.card ≤ (n + 1) / 2`: Correct for $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ in integer division if defined as such, but usually `(n+1)/2` is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ for integers.
- Partition condition: Edges are disjoint and cover all edges.
- Path definition: The formalization treats paths as sets of edges (`Finset (α × α)`). It doesn't explicitly enforce that the edges form a *path* (connected sequence of edges). It just says "paths is a set of sets of edges...".
- Missing: `∀ P ∈ paths, IsPath P` (or equivalent). The current code just checks edges are in $G$. It doesn't check the structure of $P$ is a path.

## Confidence
70% (Missing path structure constraint)
