# Review of Erdos Problem 649

## Problem Statement
For any primes $p, q$, does there exist $n$ such that $P(n)=p$ and $P(n+1)=q$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization negates this (disproved).

```lean
noncomputable def P (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem not_all_prime_pairs_consecutive ...
```

## Critique
The formalization matches the problem statement.

## Confidence
