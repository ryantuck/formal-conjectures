# Review: Erdos Problem 1157

**Problem:** Turán numbers for r-uniform hypergraphs (Brown-Erdős-Sós Conjecture)
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1157](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1157)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let t, k, r ≥ 2. Let F denote the family of all r-uniform hypergraphs with k vertices and s edges. Determine ex_r(n, F).

**Conjecture (Brown-Erdős-Sós):** For r > t ≥ 2 and s ≥ 3, ex_t(n, F) = o(n^t) whenever k ≥ (r-t)s + t + 1.

**Known lower bound (Brown-Erdős-Sós):** For all k > r and s > 1, ex_r(n, F) ≫ n^{(rs-k)/(s-1)}.

## Current Formalization

### Theorem 1 (Conjecture)

```lean
theorem brown_erdos_sos_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (r t s k : ℕ), r > t → t ≥ 2 → s ≥ 3 → k ≥ (r - t) * s + t + 1 →
      ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (fun n => (ex n : ℝ)) =o[atTop] (fun n => (n : ℝ)^t) := by
  sorry
```

### Theorem 2 (Known lower bound)

```lean
theorem turan_hypergraph_lower_bound :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (r k s : ℕ), k > r → s > 1 →
      ∃ (C : ℝ) (N : ℕ), C > 0 ∧ ∀ n ≥ N,
        ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (ex n : ℝ) ≥ C * (n : ℝ)^(((r * s - k : ℤ) : ℝ) / ((s - 1) : ℝ)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Both theorems are trivially satisfiable (CRITICAL)

**Theorem 1**: `∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ)` with `ex =o n^t` is satisfied by `ex = fun _ => 0`.

**Theorem 2**: `∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (ex n : ℝ) ≥ C * n^(...)` is satisfied by `ex = fun n => ⌈C * n^(...)⌉₊`.

The extremal number ex_r(n, F) is a specific, well-defined function — the maximum number of edges in an r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices that contains no member of F as a subhypergraph. It should be **defined** (even as sorry), not existentially quantified.

### 2. Missing hypergraph infrastructure (MAJOR)

The parameters r, t, s, k appear in the hypotheses, but there are no actual hypergraph definitions, no notion of r-uniformity, no F-freeness, and no extremal number. The formalization only states something about an arbitrary function satisfying an asymptotic bound.

### 3. Natural number subtraction issue (MODERATE)

In `k ≥ (r - t) * s + t + 1`, the subtraction `r - t` is natural number subtraction (truncated at 0). Since we have `r > t`, this is fine — r - t > 0 in ℕ. But it's worth noting.

### 4. Theorem 2 should not use answer(sorry) (MODERATE)

The lower bound is a **known result** (proved by Brown, Erdős, Sós). It should either be stated directly (without answer elaborator) or use `answer(True)`.

### 5. The asymptotic notation is correct (POSITIVE)

The use of `=o[atTop]` for the conjecture and the explicit lower bound formula for the known result are mathematically appropriate asymptotic statements.

### 6. The exponent formula in Theorem 2 is correct (POSITIVE)

`((r * s - k : ℤ) : ℝ) / ((s - 1) : ℝ)` correctly computes (rs - k)/(s - 1) using integer arithmetic to avoid natural number subtraction issues (since k > r but rs could be < k for some parameters).

## What proper formalizations would need

```lean
/-- The extremal number ex_r(n, F) for r-uniform hypergraphs avoiding family F. -/
noncomputable def extremalNumber (r : ℕ) (n : ℕ)
    (F : Set (Finset (Fin n))) : ℕ := sorry

theorem brown_erdos_sos_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (r t s k : ℕ), r > t → t ≥ 2 → s ≥ 3 → k ≥ (r - t) * s + t + 1 →
        (fun n => (extremalNumber t n sorry : ℝ)) =o[atTop]
          (fun n => (n : ℝ)^t) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **5%**

The asymptotic forms and parameter conditions are correct, but the core objects (hypergraphs, extremal numbers) are completely absent, and the existential quantifiers make both statements trivially satisfiable.
