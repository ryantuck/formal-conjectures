# Erdős Problem 1053 Review

## Problem Statement

Call a number $k$-perfect if $\sigma(n)=kn$. Must $k=o(\log\log n)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1053.lean`.

The formalization `k_perfect_growth` asks for the existence of a function $f(n)$ such that $k \le f(n)$ for all $k$-perfect $n$, and $f(n) / \log\log n 	o \infty$.
The problem asks if $k$ is *small* ($o(\log\log n)$).
The formalization asks if $k$ is bounded by something that grows *faster* than $\log\log n$.
These are contradictory or at least not equivalent. If $k=o(\log\log n)$, it is certainly bounded by something growing faster (e.g. $n$). But proving it's bounded by something growing faster doesn't prove it's $o(\log\log n)$.
The formalization seems to be a weak upper bound statement, not capturing the specific asymptotic conjecture.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect/weak.
