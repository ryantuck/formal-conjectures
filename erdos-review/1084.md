# Erdős Problem 1084 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_d(n)$ be minimal such that in any collection of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, all of distance at least $1$ apart, there are at most $f_d(n)$ many pairs of points which are distance $1$ apart. Estimate $f_d(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1084.lean`.

The function `f (d n : ℕ)` is correctly defined as the maximum number of unit distance pairs in a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that all pairwise distances are $\ge 1$.
The file includes several theorems (`upper_d1`, `upper_d2`, etc.) that formalize known bounds and specific conjectures mentioned in the problem context (e.g. triangular lattice optimality).

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
