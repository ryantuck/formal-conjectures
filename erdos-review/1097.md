# Erdős Problem 1097 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $A$ be a set of $n$ integers. How many distinct $d$ can occur as the common difference of a three-term arithmetic progression in $A$? Are there always $O(n^{3/2})$ many such $d$?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1097.lean` defines the set of common differences as:
```lean
def CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP (A : Finset ℤ) : Set ℤ :=
  {d : ℤ | d ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ b ∈ A, ∃ c ∈ A, b - a = d ∧ c - b = d}
```
The conjecture is formalized as:
```lean
theorem erdos_1097 : answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ C > (0 : ℝ), ∀ (A : Finset ℤ),
    (CommonDifferencesThreeTermAP A).ncard ≤ C * (A.card : ℝ) ^ (3 / 2 : ℝ)
```
This correctly asks if there exists a constant $C$ such that for all finite sets $A$, the number of such differences is bounded by $C |A|^{3/2}$.

## Completeness
The formalization is complete and faithful to the problem statement.

## Confidence
100%
