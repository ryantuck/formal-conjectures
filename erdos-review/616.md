# Review of Erdos Problem 616

## Problem Statement
Determine optimal bound $t$ for covering number of r-uniform hypergraphs where local covering $\le 1$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the existence of such $t$ with bounds.

```lean
theorem covering_number_bound (r : ℕ) :
    ∃ t : ℝ, (3 * r / 16 + 7 / 8 ≤ t ∧ t ≤ r / 5) ∧
      ∀ (H : RUniformHypergraph sorry r),
        (∀ (S : Finset sorry), S.card ≤ 3*r - 3 → sorry ≤ 1) →
        (coveringNumber H : ℝ) ≤ t := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the structure and known bounds.
- `coveringNumber` stubbed.
- Local condition stubbed (`sorry ≤ 1`).
- Bounds on $t$ matches the "Current bounds" in description.

## Confidence
90% (Stubbed conditions)
