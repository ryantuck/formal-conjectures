# Erdős Problem 970 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $h(k)$ be Jacobsthal's function. Determine the order of magnitude of $h(k)$. In particular, is it true that $h(k) \ll k^2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/970.lean`.

The function `h(k)` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem `jacobsthal_bound` depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
