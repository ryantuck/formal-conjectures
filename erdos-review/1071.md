# Erdős Problem 1071 Review

## Problem Statement

1. Is there a finite set of unit line segments (rotated and translated copies of $(0,1)$) in the unit square, no two of which intersect, which are maximal with respect to this property?
2. Is there a region $R$ with a maximal set of disjoint unit line segments that is countably infinite?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1071.lean`.

The predicate `SegmentsDisjoint` is defined as:
`def SegmentsDisjoint (seg1 seg2 : ℝ² × ℝ²) : Prop := segment ℝ seg1.1 seg1.2 ∩ segment ℝ seg2.1 seg2.2 ⊆ {seg1.1, seg1.2, seg2.1, seg2.2}`
This definition implies that two segments are considered "disjoint" if their intersection is contained in the set of their endpoints. This allows segments to touch at endpoints.
The problem statement uses the phrase "no two of which intersect". In standard geometric terminology, "intersect" usually includes any common point. If the problem implies strictly disjoint (empty intersection), the formalization is too weak. If the problem implies "internally disjoint" (can form a graph), then it might be correct. Given the context of "maximal set", if they can touch, it forms a structure different from a packing of disjoint segments.

The maximal condition is formalized using `Maximal` on the set of such configurations.

## Completeness

The formalization structure is correct, but the interpretation of "intersect" in `SegmentsDisjoint` should be verified against the intended meaning in the original problem (Danzer). If "disjoint" means empty intersection, the formalization is incorrect.
