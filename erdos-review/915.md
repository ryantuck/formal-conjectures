# Erdős Problem 915 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a graph with $1+n(m-1)$ vertices and $1+n\binom{m}{2}$ edges. Must $G$ contain two points which are connected by $m$ disjoint paths?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/915.lean`.

The formalization in `connectivity_disjoint_paths` differs significantly from the problem statement.
1. It does not enforce the vertex/edge counts specified in the problem ($1+n(m-1)$, etc).
2. It posits a relation between connectivity and linking $k$ pairs of vertices, rather than finding *one* pair connected by $m$ paths.
3. The formalization asks for disjoint paths between `pairs` of vertices, which is a different problem (k-linked graph) than "two points connected by m paths" (Menger-type local connectivity).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
