# Review: Erdos Problem 1115

**Problem:** Path growth in entire functions of finite order
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1115](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1115)
**Status:** DISPROVED (by Gol'dberg and Eremenko, 1979)

## Source Problem

Let f(z) be an entire function of finite order, and let Gamma be a rectifiable path on which f(z) -> infinity. Let l(r) denote the length of Gamma within the disc |z| < r, and M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|.

Questions:
1. Find a path where l(r) grows as slowly as possible
2. Estimate l(r) in terms of M(r)
3. Can such a path Gamma exist where l(r) = o(r)?

Gol'dberg and Eremenko proved that for any phi(r) -> infinity, there exists an entire function f such that log M(r) << phi(r)(log r)^2, and no rectifiable path Gamma on which f -> infinity satisfies l(r) = o(r). This disproved the possibility of always finding such slow-growing paths.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem path_growth_entire_functions :
    ∀ (φ : ℝ → ℝ), Filter.Tendsto φ Filter.atTop Filter.atTop →
      ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), Differentiable ℂ f ∧
        (∀ᶠ r in Filter.atTop,
          Real.log (⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖) ≤
            φ r * (Real.log r) ^ 2) ∧
        ¬∃ (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (hγ : Continuous γ),
          Filter.Tendsto (fun t => ‖f (γ t)‖) Filter.atTop Filter.atTop ∧
          ∃ (pathLength : ℝ → ℝ),
            Filter.Tendsto (fun r => pathLength r / r) Filter.atTop (𝓝 0) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Overall structure is correct (POSITIVE)

The rewrite is a dramatic improvement over the previous version (which was entirely vacuous with `True` placeholders). The current version correctly:
- Universally quantifies over phi(r) -> infinity
- Existentially produces an entire function f
- States the growth bound log M(r) <= phi(r)(log r)^2
- Negates the existence of a suitable path

### 2. M(r) definition uses iSup over a non-compact type (MODERATE)

The expression `⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖` takes the supremum over all z in C with norm r. For Lean's `iSup`, this is the supremum over a subtype. Since entire functions are continuous and the circle is compact, the supremum is attained, but the `iSup` formulation using a dependent pair (z : C) (_ : ||z|| = r) may not behave well without establishing that the set is nonempty and bounded. This is a minor technical concern for the proof rather than a statement-level issue.

### 3. Missing finite order condition on f (MODERATE)

The source problem specifies that f should be an entire function of **finite order**. The formalization requires `Differentiable ℂ f` (entireness) and the growth bound `log M(r) <= phi(r)(log r)^2`, which for slowly growing phi implies that f has order at most 2 (since log M(r) is controlled by (log r)^2 up to a slowly growing factor). However, the Gol'dberg-Eremenko result actually constructs functions of **any prescribed finite order**, so the growth bound alone does not explicitly encode the finite order condition. The growth bound is part of the conclusion, not a hypothesis, so the finite order condition is implicitly captured but only for order roughly <= 2. This is acceptable as a formalization of the specific Gol'dberg-Eremenko result.

### 4. Path characterization is informal (MODERATE)

The path is modeled as `γ : ℝ → ℂ` with `Continuous γ` and `f(γ(t)) -> ∞`. The source requires a **rectifiable** path. Continuity alone does not imply rectifiability (e.g., space-filling curves are continuous but not rectifiable). However, the formalization then introduces `pathLength : ℝ → ℝ` as an abstract function representing the length of gamma within a disc of radius r, without formally defining it or tying it to the actual arc length of gamma. This means `pathLength` is unconstrained -- it could be any function, not necessarily related to the actual geometric path length.

Concretely, the negation says: there is no continuous gamma with f(gamma(t)) -> infinity AND a function pathLength with pathLength(r)/r -> 0. Since pathLength is existentially quantified inside the negation, the negation says: for all gamma, for all pathLength functions... This actually strengthens the claim beyond what the source states (it says no such gamma exists with ANY function that tends to 0 after dividing by r). But since pathLength is unconstrained, the negation means: for every continuous path gamma on which f -> infinity, and every function called pathLength, either pathLength(r)/r does not tend to 0, or... The issue is that pathLength has no connection to gamma, so this is not correct.

Wait, re-reading: the negation is `¬∃ (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (hγ : Continuous γ), [condition on γ] ∧ ∃ pathLength, [condition on pathLength]`. So it says: there does NOT exist γ continuous with f(γ(t)) -> ∞ such that there exists pathLength with pathLength(r)/r -> 0. Since pathLength is unconstrained and existentially quantified, one can always take pathLength = 0 to get pathLength(r)/r -> 0 trivially. This means the ∃ pathLength clause is always satisfiable, so the negation reduces to: there does NOT exist γ continuous with f(γ(t)) -> ∞. This is a MUCH stronger statement than the source, which only says no such path has l(r) = o(r). The source allows paths on which f -> ∞ to exist; it just says their path length within discs must grow at least linearly.

**This is a CRITICAL bug.** The unconstrained existential pathLength makes the inner clause trivially satisfiable, so the negation says "no path exists on which f -> infinity at all," which is far too strong.

### 5. The `≤` vs `≪` asymptotic (MINOR)

The source uses `log M(r) << phi(r)(log r)^2` meaning log M(r) = O(phi(r)(log r)^2). The formalization uses `≤` eventually, which is slightly different (O notation allows a constant factor), but this is a reasonable simplification since phi is arbitrary and can absorb constants.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem path_growth_entire_functions :
    ∀ (φ : ℝ → ℝ), Filter.Tendsto φ Filter.atTop Filter.atTop →
      ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), Differentiable ℂ f ∧
        (∀ᶠ r in Filter.atTop,
          Real.log (⨆ (z : ℂ) (_ : ‖z‖ = r), ‖f z‖) ≤
            φ r * (Real.log r) ^ 2) ∧
        ∀ (γ : ℝ → ℂ), Continuous γ →
          Filter.Tendsto (fun t => ‖f (γ t)‖) Filter.atTop Filter.atTop →
          ¬Filter.Tendsto (fun r =>
            (pathLengthInDisc γ r) / r) Filter.atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  sorry
```

The key fix is: (1) pathLength must be a DEFINED function of gamma (the arc length of gamma restricted to the disc of radius r), not an unconstrained existential; (2) the negation should be on the path-length growth condition, not on the existence of the path itself. In practice, defining `pathLengthInDisc` formally is challenging in Lean, but the logical structure should be: for all paths gamma on which f -> infinity, the path length in discs of radius r is NOT o(r).

## Confidence: **35%**

The formalization captures the correct theorem (Gol'dberg-Eremenko), uses the right quantifier structure (for all phi, exists f), and includes the growth bound. However, the critical bug with the unconstrained existential pathLength makes the negation too strong -- it inadvertently claims no path to infinity exists at all, rather than that no such path has sub-linear arc length growth. The mathematical intent is clearly correct, but the formal statement does not match.
