# Review: Erdos Problem 1115

**Problem:** Path growth in entire functions of finite order
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1115](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1115)
**Status:** SOLVED (partially proved by Hayman 1960, disproved in general by Gol'dberg & Eremenko 1979)

## Source Problem

Let f(z) be an entire function of finite order, and let Gamma be a rectifiable path on which f(z) -> infinity. Let l(r) denote the length of Gamma within the disc |z| < r.

Questions:
1. Find a path where l(r) grows as slowly as possible
2. Estimate l(r) in terms of M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|
3. Can such a path Gamma exist where l(r) << r (i.e., l(r) = o(r))?

Hayman (1960) showed that if log M(r) << (log r)^2, then a path with l(r) = r exists. Gol'dberg and Eremenko (1979) showed that for any phi(r) -> infinity, there exists an entire function with log M(r) << phi(r)(log r)^2 such that no path with l(r) << r exists.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem path_growth_entire_functions :
    answer(False) ↔ (∃ f : ℂ → ℂ, ∃ path : ℝ → ℂ,
      (∃ order : ℝ, 0 < order ∧ True) ∧ -- f is entire of finite order (placeholder)
      True) := by -- Some property about path growth that doesn't hold
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Statement is vacuous / trivially true on the RHS (CRITICAL)

The RHS simplifies to: there exists f : C -> C and path : R -> C such that there exists order > 0 and True, which is trivially true (take any f, any path, order = 1). The `True` placeholders carry no mathematical content.

Since the RHS is trivially true, `answer(False) <-> True` would require answer(False) to be True, which depends on the answer elaborator but would typically make this unprovable or trivially false.

### 2. No actual mathematical content (CRITICAL)

All the substantive mathematics is replaced by `True`:
- "f is entire of finite order" is replaced by `∃ order : ℝ, 0 < order ∧ True`
- "Some property about path growth" is replaced by `True`
- The path length function l(r) is never defined
- The growth condition l(r) << r is absent
- The maximum modulus M(r) is absent
- The condition f(z) -> infinity along Gamma is absent

### 3. The answer(False) framing is questionable (MODERATE)

The problem is not simply "true or false." It asks multiple questions about how slowly l(r) can grow. Gol'dberg and Eremenko showed that in general, one cannot always achieve l(r) = o(r), which could be interpreted as a "disproved" result for question 3. But the formalization should capture what specifically was disproved.

### 4. Missing path rectifiability (CRITICAL)

The source requires the path to be rectifiable. The formalization uses `path : R -> C` with no continuity, rectifiability, or regularity conditions.

### 5. Missing f(z) -> infinity along path (CRITICAL)

The key property that f(z) -> infinity along the path is completely absent.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- For any phi(r) -> infinity, there exists an entire function f of finite order
    with log M(r) << phi(r)(log r)^2 such that no rectifiable path Gamma
    on which f -> infinity satisfies l(r) = o(r) -/
theorem path_growth_entire_functions :
    ∀ (φ : ℝ → ℝ), Filter.Tendsto φ Filter.atTop Filter.atTop →
      ∃ (f : ℂ → ℂ), Differentiable ℂ f ∧
        -- f has finite order, log M(r) << φ(r)(log r)^2
        (∀ᶠ r in Filter.atTop,
          Real.log (⨆ z : Metric.sphere (0 : ℂ) r, ‖f z‖) ≤
            φ r * (Real.log r) ^ 2) ∧
        -- no rectifiable path on which f -> ∞ has l(r) = o(r)
        ¬∃ (γ : ℝ → ℂ),
          Filter.Tendsto (fun t => ‖f (γ t)‖) Filter.atTop Filter.atTop ∧
          (∀ᶠ r in Filter.atTop,
            sorry /- l(r) = o(r), length of γ in disc of radius r -/ ) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization is an empty shell with only `True` placeholders. No mathematical content from the source problem is present. The statement is trivially true on the RHS, making the overall statement logically incoherent.
