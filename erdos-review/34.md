# Erdős Problem 34 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that $S(\pi) = o(n^2)$ for all $\pi \in S_n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/34.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_34` asks if `answer(False)` corresponds to the $o(n^2)$ bound holding for the max distinct consecutive sums. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
