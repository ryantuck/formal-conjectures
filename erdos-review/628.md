# Review of Erdos Problem 628

## Problem Statement
If $\chi(G)=k$ and $K_k \not\subseteq G$, can $G$ be split into disjoint subgraphs with $\chi \ge a$ and $\chi \ge b$ ($a+b=k+1$)?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks if such split exists.

```lean
theorem chromatic_k_is_splittable ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `IsSplittable` stubbed but name implies intent.
- Conditions on $a,b,k$ match.

## Confidence
100%
