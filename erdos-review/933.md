# Erdős Problem 933 Review

## Problem Statement

If $n(n+1)=2^k3^lm$, where $(m,6)=1$, then is it true that $\limsup_{n	o \infty} \frac{2^k3^l}{n\log n}=\infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/933.lean`.

The formalization `prime_power_product_growth` and `maxPrimePowerExp` investigate the *largest prime power* divisor of $n(n+1)$ among all primes.
The problem statement asks about the magnitude of the specific factor $2^k 3^l$ (the 2,3-smooth part).
The formalization is asking a different question (about max prime power component vs specific 2,3 component).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
