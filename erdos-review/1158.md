# Review: Erdos Problem 1158

**Problem:** Turán number for complete multipartite hypergraphs
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1158](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1158)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let K_t(r) be the complete t-partite t-uniform hypergraph with r vertices in each class. Is it true that

  ex_t(n, K_t(r)) ≥ n^{t - r^{1-t} - o(1)}?

Known: Erdős established n^{t - O(r^{1-t})} ≤ ex_t(n, K_t(r)) ≪ n^{t - r^{1-t}}. Verified only for t = 2 and 2 ≤ r ≤ 3. The case t = 2 is Problem 714.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem turan_complete_multipartite_hypergraph_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (t r : ℕ), t > 0 → r > 0 →
      ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
      ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N,
        ∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ), (ex n : ℝ) ≥ (n : ℝ)^((t : ℝ) - (r : ℝ)^(1 - (t : ℝ)) - ε) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Trivially satisfiable (CRITICAL)

`∃ (ex : ℕ → ℕ)` can be chosen freely. For any lower bound B, define ex(n) = ⌈B⌉₊. The statement is provable without any reference to hypergraphs or Turán numbers.

The extremal number ex_t(n, K_t(r)) is a specific well-defined quantity. It must be defined, not existentially quantified.

### 2. Missing K_t(r) definition (MAJOR)

The complete t-partite t-uniform hypergraph K_t(r) with r vertices per class is not defined. This is the central object of the problem.

### 3. Source says t ≥ 2, formalization says t > 0 (MODERATE)

The source problem is about t-uniform hypergraphs with t ≥ 2. The formalization weakens this to t > 0, which includes the degenerate case t = 1 (1-uniform "hypergraphs" = vertices, which is trivial).

### 4. The exponent formula is correct (POSITIVE)

`(t : ℝ) - (r : ℝ)^(1 - (t : ℝ)) - ε` correctly represents t - r^{1-t} - ε, capturing the o(1) correction via ∀ ε > 0. This is the mathematically standard way to express n^{t - r^{1-t} - o(1)}.

### 5. The "for all ε > 0, eventually" structure is correct (POSITIVE)

Using `∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 → ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N` to express the o(1) correction is the right approach.

## What a proper formalization would need

```lean
/-- The complete t-partite t-uniform hypergraph with r vertices in each class. -/
def completeMultipartiteHypergraph (t r : ℕ) : sorry := sorry

/-- The Turán number for t-uniform hypergraphs. -/
noncomputable def turanNumber (t : ℕ) (n : ℕ) (H : sorry) : ℕ := sorry

theorem turan_complete_multipartite_hypergraph_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (t r : ℕ), t ≥ 2 → r > 0 →
      ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
      ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ n ≥ N,
        (turanNumber t n (completeMultipartiteHypergraph t r) : ℝ) ≥
          (n : ℝ)^((t : ℝ) - (r : ℝ)^(1 - (t : ℝ)) - ε) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **5%**

The exponent formula is correct and the o(1) → ε approach is right. But the statement is trivially satisfiable, the Turán number is not defined, and the multipartite hypergraph is absent.
