# Erdős Problem 914 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $r\geq 2$ and $m\geq 1$. Every graph with $rm$ vertices and minimum degree at least $m(r-1)$ contains $m$ vertex disjoint copies of $K_r$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/914.lean`.

The statement correctly imposes the minimum degree condition.
It asserts existence of $m$ disjoint cliques of size $r$.
`Disjoint C₁ C₂` on finsets of vertices means vertex disjoint.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
