# Erdős Problem 1064 Review

## Problem Statement

Prove that $\phi(n) > \phi(n-\phi(n))$ for almost all $n$, but that $\phi(n) < \phi(n-\phi(n))$ for infinitely many $n$, where $\phi$ is Euler's totient function.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1064.lean`.

The first part "for almost all $n$" is formalized as `{n | φ n > φ (n - φ n)}.HasDensity 1`. This corresponds to asymptotic density 1.
The second part "for infinitely many $n$" is formalized as `{n | φ n < φ (n - φ n)}.Infinite`.

The formalization uses `Nat.phi` (denoted as `φ`), which is the Euler totient function.

## Completeness

The formalization directly translates the problem statement into Lean.
