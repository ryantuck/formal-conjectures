# Review: Erdos Problem 1131

**Problem:** Minimal value of integral of squared Lagrange basis functions
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1131](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1131)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

For points x_1,...,x_n in [-1,1], define the Lagrange basis polynomials l_k(x). Find the minimal value of:

  I(x_1,...,x_n) = integral_{-1}^{1} sum_k |l_k(x)|^2 dx

Conjecture: Is it true that min I = 2 - (1 + o(1)) / n?

Known bounds: 2 - O((log n)^2 / n) <= min I <= 2 - 2/(2n-1).

## Current Formalization

```lean
/-- Integral of squared Lagrange basis functions -/
noncomputable def I {n : ℕ} (x : Fin n → ℝ) : ℝ := sorry

/-- Minimum integral of squared Lagrange basis functions -/
@[category research open, AMS 41]
theorem lagrange_basis_integral_minimum (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ (c : ℝ), 0 < c ∧
      ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
        I x ≥ 2 - (1 + c) / n := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Approximation of conjecture structure is reasonable but imprecise (MODERATE)

The source conjecture is min I = 2 - (1 + o(1))/n. The formalization states that for some positive c, I(x) >= 2 - (1+c)/n for all nodes x. This captures a lower bound, but the conjecture is really about the precise asymptotic form of the minimum. The formalization does not capture the o(1) term (which should vanish as n -> infinity); instead c is a fixed positive constant independent of n. This means the formalization is asking whether I(x) >= 2 - (1+c)/n for a fixed c > 0, which is weaker than the full conjecture.

### 2. Missing the "minimum over x" structure (MODERATE)

The conjecture asks about min_x I(x_1,...,x_n), the infimum over all choices of nodes. The formalization instead states a universal lower bound: for ALL x, I(x) >= 2 - (1+c)/n. This is actually one direction of the conjecture (lower bound), but does not capture the matching upper bound that would show the minimum is precisely 2 - (1+o(1))/n.

### 3. Should use answer elaborator for open problem (MODERATE)

This is an open problem phrased as a yes/no question ("Is it true that min I = 2 - (1+o(1))/n?"). The formalization does not use the `answer(sorry)` elaborator, which is the standard pattern for open yes/no problems. Instead it directly asserts the lower bound direction.

### 4. Definition of I is opaque (MODERATE)

The definition `I` is `sorry`, so we cannot verify that it actually computes the integral of squared Lagrange basis functions. The definition should ideally use `MeasureTheory.integral` applied to the sum of squared Lagrange basis evaluations.

### 5. Missing distinctness constraint on nodes (MINOR)

Lagrange interpolation requires distinct nodes (otherwise the basis functions are undefined due to division by zero). The formalization does not require Function.Injective x.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem lagrange_basis_integral_minimum :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
        ∀ᶠ n in atTop,
          ∀ (x : Fin n → ℝ), Function.Injective x →
            (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1) →
            I x ≥ 2 - (1 + ε) / n := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **30%**

The formalization captures the correct mathematical theme and the approximate shape of the bound (2 - something/n), with the correct constant 1 in (1+c). However, it lacks the asymptotic o(1) structure, does not use the answer elaborator for an open problem, has an opaque sorry definition, and misses the distinctness constraint. It captures the lower bound direction but not the full two-sided asymptotic.
