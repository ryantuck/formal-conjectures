# Erdős Problem 960 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_{r,k}(n)$ be the threshold for ordinary lines. Is it true that $f_{r,k}(n)=o(n^2)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/960.lean`.

The theorem `ordinary_lines_threshold` asserts the existence of a threshold function `f`.
It does not ask about the asymptotic behavior of `f` (the core conjecture).
It merely defines `f` via an existential quantifier.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete/weak.

## Confidence
