# Erdős Problem 905 Review

## Problem Statement

Every graph with $n$ vertices and $>n^2/4$ edges contains an edge which is in at least $n/6$ triangles.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/905.lean`.

The theorem `edge_many_triangles` correctly states that if edge count $> n^2/4$, there exists an edge $(a,b)$ such that the number of common neighbors (vertices forming a triangle with $a,b$) is $\ge n/6$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
