# Review of Erdos Problem 650

## Problem Statement
Estimate $f(m)$ for divisibility in intervals. Is $f(m) \ll m^{1/2}$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks if $f(m) \ll m^{1/2+\epsilon}$.

```lean
noncomputable def f (m : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem divisibility_intervals (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ ε > 0, ... (f m : ℝ) < (m : ℝ) ^ (1/2 + ε)
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the "Estimate/Is it true" question.
- `f` is stubbed.
- Bound $m^{1/2+\epsilon}$ is a reasonable interpretation of $\ll m^{1/2}$ in context of "Is it true that ...".
