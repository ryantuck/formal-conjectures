# Erdős Problem 1010 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $t<\lfloor n/2floor$. Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4floor+t$ edges contain at least $t\lfloor n/2floor$ triangles?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1010.lean`.

The theorem `triangle_count_dense` correctly states the hypothesis on the number of edges and the conclusion about the number of triangles (cliques of size 3).
The bound on $t$ is correctly included.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
