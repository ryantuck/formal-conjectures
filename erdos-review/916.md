# Erdős Problem 916 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every graph with $n$ vertices and $2n-2$ edges contain a cycle and another vertex adjacent to three vertices on the cycle?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/916.lean`.

The formalization `cycles_adjacent_vertices` assumes `∀ v : Fin n, k ≤ G.degree v`.
This enforces a minimum degree of $k$, instead of the global edge count condition ($2n-2$ edges).
The problem does not require minimum degree.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
