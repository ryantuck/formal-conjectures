# Review of Erdos Problem 637

## Problem Statement
Every graph contains an induced subgraph on $\gg n$ vertices with $\gg n^{1/2}$ distinct degrees. (Improved to $n^{2/3}$).

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts existence of induced subgraph with many distinct degrees.

```lean
theorem induced_subgraph_distinct_degrees :
    ... ∃ (S : Finset (Fin n)),
      (Finset.univ.image (fun v => (S.filter ...).card)).card
            ≥ Nat.floor (c * (n : ℝ) ^ (2/3))
```

## Critique
- Distinct degrees count is formalized correctly.
- Bound $n^{2/3}$ uses the improved result.
- Missing condition: $|S| \gg n$ ("induced subgraph on $\gg n$ vertices"). The formalization allows $S$ to be any size (though to have $n^{2/3}$ distinct degrees, it must be somewhat large, but the problem explicitly requires linear size subgraph).

## Confidence
80% (Missing size condition on subgraph)
