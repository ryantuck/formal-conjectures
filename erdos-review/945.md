# Erdős Problem 945 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $F(x)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist $n+1,\ldots,n+k\leq x$ with $	au(n+1),\ldots,	au(n+k)$ all distinct. Is it true that $F(x) \leq (\log x)^{O(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/945.lean`.

`F(x)` is correctly defined.
The theorem `erdos_945` asks if $F(x) \le (\log x)^{O(1)}$.
Note: The formalization `F x ≤ log x ^ O x` where `O` is bounded essentially means $O(1)$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
