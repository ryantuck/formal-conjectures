# Review of Erdos Problem 575

## Problem Statement
If $\mathcal{F}$ contains a bipartite graph, does there exist some bipartite $G \in \mathcal{F}$ such that
$$ \mathrm{ex}(n; G) \ll_{\mathcal{F}} \mathrm{ex}(n; \mathcal{F})? $$

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks if a bipartite $G \in F$ exists such that `ex(n; F) ≤ c * ex(n; {G})`.

```lean

    (h_bipartite : ∃ G ∈ F, IsBipartite G) :
    ∃ (G : SimpleGraph ℕ) (hG : G ∈ F), IsBipartite G ∧
      ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop,
        (extremalNumber n F.toSet : ℝ) ≤ c * (extremalNumber n {G} : ℝ) := by

## Critique
The formalization captures the inequality logic correctly, but the direction seems inverted in the textual description or the problem statement interpretation.
- Problem: $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \ll \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$. This usually means $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) = o(\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F}))$ or strictly smaller order.
- However, for any $G \in \mathcal{F}$, a graph avoiding $G$ might *not* avoid other graphs in $\mathcal{F}$, so $\mathrm{ex}(n; G) \ge \mathrm{ex}(n; \mathcal{F})$ is the trivial inequality (if you avoid *all* in F, you avoid G, so the set of F-free graphs is a subset of G-free graphs? No. If a graph contains no G from F, it is F-free. If it contains no G, it is G-free. Being F-free is harder than being G-free? No.
- Let's re-read: "maximum number of edges ... without containing *any* subgraphs from F".
- If $H$ is F-free, it contains NO graph from F.
- If $H$ is G-free (where $G \in F$), it contains NO G.
- If $H$ is F-free, does it imply it is G-free? Yes, because G is in F. If it contained G, it would contain a subgraph from F.
- So {F-free graphs} $\subseteq$ {G-free graphs}.
- Thus $\mathrm{ex}(n; \mathcal{F}) \le \mathrm{ex}(n; G)$.
- The problem statement asks if $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \ll \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$?
- That would imply $\mathrm{ex}(n;G)$ is *much smaller* than $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$. But we just argued $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \ge \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$.
- This suggests the notation $\ll$ might mean something else, or I am misinterpreting, or the problem asks if they are comparable (Big O).
- The formalization uses `(extremalNumber n F.toSet : ℝ) ≤ c * (extremalNumber n {G} : ℝ)`. This says $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F}) \le c \cdot \mathrm{ex}(n;G)$. Since we always have $\le$, this is asking if they are of the same order (since $\le$ is trivial with $c=1$, asking for $\ge$ would be interesting, or asking if they are close).
- Wait, the problem on the website says: `ex(n;G) << ex(n;F)`.
- If $A \ll B$ usually means $A = o(B)$ (A is negligible compared to B).
- If $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \ge \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$ always, then $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \ll \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$ is impossible (unless both are 0).
- Perhaps the problem asks if $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F}) \sim \mathrm{ex}(n;G)$?
- Let's look at the Lean code again: `(extremalNumber n F.toSet : ℝ) ≤ c * (extremalNumber n {G} : ℝ)`.
- The code asks if $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F}) \le O(\mathrm{ex}(n;G))$. Since $\le$ is trivial, this theorem is trivially true with $c=1$.
- Something is wrong.
- Let's check the website text again: "Note that it is trivial that $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})\leq \mathrm{ex}(n;G)$ for every $G\in\mathcal{F}$. Is it true that ... there exists some bipartite $G\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\ll_{\mathcal{F}}\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$?"
- This is definitely asking if $\mathrm{ex}(n;G)$ can be bounded *by* $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$.
- Given the trivial $\le$, the only non-trivial relation is $\ge$ (or approximate equality).
- If the problem writes $A \ll B$, and we know $B \le A$, then it might be a typo in my reading or the website, OR it uses $\ll$ to mean "is bounded by a constant times" (i.e., $A \le C B$).
- If it means $A \le C B$, then $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \le C \cdot \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$.
- Combining with trivial $\mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F}) \le \mathrm{ex}(n;G)$, this would mean $\mathrm{ex}(n;G) \asymp \mathrm{ex}(n;\mathcal{F})$.
- The Lean code asks: `ex(n;F) ≤ c * ex(n;G)`. This is the trivial direction.
- The code should likely be: `ex(n;G) ≤ c * ex(n;F)`.
- **Verdict:** The formalization likely captures the *trivial* direction instead of the *conjectured* direction.
