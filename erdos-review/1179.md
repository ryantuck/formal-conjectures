# Review: Erdos Problem 1179

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1179.lean`
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1179](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1179)
**Status:** PROVED (solved in the affirmative)

## Original Problem

For $0 < \varepsilon < 1$, let $g_\varepsilon(N)$ be the **minimal** $k$ such that: if $G$ is an abelian group of size $N$ and $A \subseteq G$ is a uniformly random subset of size $k$, then with probability $\to 1$ as $N \to \infty$:

$$|F_A(g) - 2^k / N| \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^k / N \quad \text{for all } g \in G$$

where $F_A(g) = \#\{S \subseteq A : g = \sum_{x \in S} x\}$ counts the number of subsets of $A$ whose elements sum to $g$.

**Main question:** Is $g_\varepsilon(N) = (1 + o_\varepsilon(1)) \log_2 N$?

Key results: Erdos-Renyi (1965) proved $g_\varepsilon(N) \le (2 + o(1)) \log_2 N$; Erdos-Hall (1976) proved $g_\varepsilon(N) \le (1 + O(\log\log\log N / \log\log N)) \log_2 N$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem subset_sum_asymptotic_estimate :
    answer(True) ↔
      ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ε < 1 →
        ∃ (g_ε : ℕ → ℕ),
          (fun N => (g_ε N : ℝ)) ~[atTop] (fun N => Real.log N / Real.log 2) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format (`answer(True)`) | Yes | Correctly uses `answer(True)` since the problem is solved |
| Universality over $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ | Yes | `∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ε < 1 →` is correct |
| Asymptotic $\sim \log_2 N$ | Partially | Uses `~[atTop]` which correctly encodes $f(N) / g(N) \to 1$ |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research solved, AMS 11]` is appropriate |

### What the formalization is missing

1. **Definition of $g_\varepsilon(N)$ (Critical):** The formalization uses `∃ (g_ε : ℕ → ℕ)` — it asserts the existence of *some* function with the right asymptotic. But the original problem defines $g_\varepsilon(N)$ as a *specific* quantity (the minimal $k$ with the probabilistic uniformity property). Without this definition, the statement is trivially true: take `g_ε(N) = ⌊log₂ N⌋` and the existential is satisfied regardless of any combinatorial content.

2. **Abelian group structure:** The problem is about abelian groups $G$ of size $N$. The formalization makes no reference to groups at all.

3. **Subset sum counting function $F_A(g)$:** The function that counts how many subsets of $A$ sum to a given group element $g$ is central to the problem and entirely absent.

4. **Probabilistic condition:** The "with probability $\to 1$ as $N \to \infty$" over uniformly random subsets $A \subseteq G$ of size $k$ is not formalized. This would require measure-theoretic or combinatorial probability.

5. **$\varepsilon$-uniformity condition:** The deviation bound $|F_A(g) - 2^k/N| \le \varepsilon \cdot 2^k/N$ is the core analytic condition and is not present.

6. **Minimality of $k$:** $g_\varepsilon(N)$ is defined as the *minimal* $k$ satisfying the condition, which constrains both upper and lower bounds.

### Structural issue

The formalization effectively says: "For all $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, there exists a function $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that is asymptotic to $\log_2$." This is a trivially true statement that has no connection to abelian groups, subset sums, or combinatorial probability. The entire mathematical substance of the problem is missing.

## Suggested improvements

A more complete formalization would define $g_\varepsilon(N)$ explicitly, or at minimum introduce the key ingredients:

```
-- Sketch of what a fuller formalization might look like:
-- 1. Define subset sum counting: for A ⊆ G, F_A(g) = #{S ⊆ A : ∑ x in S, x = g}
-- 2. Define the ε-uniformity condition on A
-- 3. Define g_ε(N) as the minimal k such that a random A of size k satisfies
--    ε-uniformity w.h.p. for all abelian groups G of size N
-- 4. State: g_ε(N) ~[atTop] log₂ N
```

Even a partial formalization that defines the subset sum count and the uniformity condition — leaving the probabilistic part as a hypothesis — would be a significant improvement.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 10%**

The formalization captures the *form* of the conclusion ($\sim \log_2 N$) but none of the mathematical content that defines the quantity being estimated. The statement as written is trivially satisfiable and does not meaningfully represent the problem.
