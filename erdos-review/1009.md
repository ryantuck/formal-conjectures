# Erdős Problem 1009 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for every $c>0$, there exists $f(c)$ such that every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\lfloor n^2/4floor+k$ edges, where $k<c n$, contains at least $k-f(c)$ many edge disjoint triangles?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1009.lean`.

The formalization uses `Disjoint T₁ T₂` for triangles $T_1, T_2 \in 	ext{Finset (Finset (Fin n))}$.
Since $T_i$ are sets of vertices, `Disjoint` means they share no vertices (vertex-disjoint).
The problem asks for "edge disjoint triangles". Two triangles can share a vertex but be edge-disjoint.
The formalization is therefore too strong and does not match the problem statement.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
