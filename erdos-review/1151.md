# Review: Erdos Problem 1151

**Problem:** Lagrange interpolation and limit points
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1151](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1151)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

When a_i are Chebyshev nodes, prove that for any closed set A ⊆ [-1,1], there exists a continuous function f such that A is precisely the set of limit points of the sequence {L^n f(x)}, where L^n f is the degree n-1 Lagrange interpolation polynomial at the Chebyshev nodes.

Erdos (1941) showed that for x = cos(πp/q), there exists continuous f with L^n f(x) → ∞. Erdos (1943) claimed (without proof) that for any closed set A, a continuous f exists with the limit-point set equal to A.

The source notes ambiguity about whether the result should hold for fixed x or arbitrary x ∈ [-1,1].

## Current Formalization

```lean
noncomputable def chebyshevNodes (n : ℕ) (i : Fin n) : ℝ :=
  Real.cos (Real.pi * (2 * (i : ℝ) + 1) / (2 * n))

noncomputable def lagrangeInterp {n : ℕ} (nodes : Fin n → ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) : ℝ → ℝ := sorry

theorem lagrange_interpolation_limit_points :
    ∀ (A : Set ℝ), IsClosed A → A ⊆ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1 →
      ∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), Continuous f ∧
        (∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1,
          {y | ∃ (seq : ℕ → ℕ), Tendsto seq atTop atTop ∧
            Tendsto (fun n => lagrangeInterp (chebyshevNodes (seq n)) f x) atTop (𝓝 y)} = A) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Good overall structure**: The quantification (∀ closed A ⊆ [-1,1], ∃ continuous f, ...) correctly captures the problem.

2. **Chebyshev nodes correctly defined**: cos(π(2i+1)/(2n)) is the standard Chebyshev nodes of the first kind formula.

3. **Subsequential limits correctly characterize limit points**: The set {y | ∃ seq, Tendsto seq atTop atTop ∧ Tendsto (...) atTop (𝓝 y)} is exactly the set of subsequential limits, which equals the set of limit points (accumulation points) of the sequence. This is mathematically correct.

### Issues

1. **`lagrangeInterp` is sorry (MODERATE)**: The key definition is completely unimplemented. While this is understandable as a placeholder, it means the statement's correctness depends entirely on what `lagrangeInterp` eventually becomes. The function should take n nodes and return the unique polynomial of degree ≤ n-1 interpolating f at those nodes.

2. **Universal over x may be too strong (MINOR)**: The formalization asks for the limit-point set to equal A for ALL x ∈ [-1,1]. The source notes ambiguity about whether this should hold for fixed x or all x. The current formulation is the strongest possible reading. If the problem only intends this for a specific x (like the ones Erdos considered in 1941), the formalization is too strong.

3. **Missing `answer(sorry) ↔` format**: The source says Erdos "claimed" this result, making it more of a conjecture. However, it's phrased as "prove that...", which could justify a direct statement format. Borderline.

4. **Limit points should include ±∞ case**: The source mentions Erdos (1941) showed L^n f(x) → ∞, suggesting the limit-point set might need to include infinite limits. The current formulation only considers finite limit points in ℝ, which may not capture the full problem when A is unbounded. However, since A ⊆ [-1,1] is bounded, this may not matter.

## Confidence: **40%**

Good structural match, but the key `lagrangeInterp` definition is sorry, and the universal quantification over x may be too strong. If `lagrangeInterp` were properly defined and the x-quantification matches the intended problem, confidence would rise to ~70%.
