# Review of Erdos Problem 600

## Problem Statement
Let $e(n,r)$ be minimal such that every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $e(n,r)$ edges, each edge contained in at least one triangle, must have an edge contained in at least $r$ triangles.
Is it true that $e(n,r+1)-e(n,r) \to \infty$?
Is it true that $e(n,r+1)/e(n,r) \to 1$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization captures the limits correctly.

```lean
noncomputable def e (n r : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry

theorem e_difference_diverges ...
theorem e_ratio_to_one ...
```

## Critique
The formalization matches the problem statement.
- `e` is defined (stub).
- Limits are expressed using filters.

## Confidence
100%
