# Erdős Problem 957 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of size $n$. Is it true that $f(d_1)f(d_k) \leq (	frac{9}{8}+o(1))n^2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/957.lean`.

The theorem `extreme_distance_product` correctly bounds the product of the frequency of the minimum distance and the maximum distance by $(9/8+\epsilon)n^2$ for large $n$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
