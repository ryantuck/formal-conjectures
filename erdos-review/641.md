# Review of Erdos Problem 641

## Problem Statement
Does $\chi(G) \ge f(k)$ imply $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertices?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization negates the existence of such $f$.

```lean
theorem not_chromatic_implies_edge_disjoint_cycles :
    ¬ ∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, ... sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton (`sorry` in the conclusion). The condition "contains k edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertices" is not formalized.

## Confidence
50% (Stub condition)
