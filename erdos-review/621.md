# Review of Erdos Problem 621

## Problem Statement
Is $\alpha_1(G) + \tau_1(G) \le n^2/4$?
$\alpha_1$: max edges with $\le 1$ edge per triangle.
$\tau_1$: min edges hitting every triangle.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization tests the inequality.

```lean
noncomputable def α₁ ...
noncomputable def τ₁ ...
theorem edge_packing_covering_bound ...
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- Definitions stubbed.
- Inequality matches.

## Confidence
100%
