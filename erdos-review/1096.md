# Erdős Problem 1096 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $1 < q < 1+\epsilon$ and consider the set of numbers of the shape $\sum_{i\in S}q^i$ (for all finite $S$), ordered by size as $0=x_1<x_2<\cdots$.
Is it true that, provided $\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small, $x_{k+1}-x_k 	o 0$?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1096.lean` is:
```lean
theorem qadic_gap_distribution (q : ℝ) (hq : 1 < q) :
    ∃ (ε : ℝ), 0 < ε ∧ q < 1 + ε →
      sorry := by
  sorry
```
The formalization is incomplete. The conclusion regarding the gap distribution ($x_{k+1}-x_k 	o 0$) is missing. Additionally, the quantifier structure seems to fix $q$ before asserting the existence of $\epsilon$, whereas the problem statement implies a universal quantifier over $q$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\exists \epsilon > 0, \forall q \in (1, 1+\epsilon), \dots$).

## Completeness
