# Erdős Problem 7 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a covering system of congruences with distinct moduli such that all moduli are odd?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/7.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_7` checks if `answer(False)` is equivalent to the existence of a `StrictCoveringSystem` with all moduli odd (`... % 2 = 1`) and greater than 1. This captures the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
