# Erdős Problem 989 Review

## Problem Statement

If $A=\{z_1,z_2,\ldots \}\in \mathbb{R}^2$, let $f(r)=\max_C \left\lvert \lvert A\cap Cvert-\pi r^2ightvert$. Is $f(r)$ unbounded for every $A$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/989.lean`.

The function `f` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
