# Erdős Problem 1024 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be such that every $3$-uniform linear hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains an independent set on $f(n)$ vertices. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1024.lean`.

The function `f` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
