# Erdős Problem 1051 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that if $1\leq a_1<a_2<\cdots$ is a sequence of integers with $\liminf a_n^{1/2^n}>1$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_na_{n+1}}$ is irrational?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1051.lean`.

The formalization `erdos_1051` correctly defines the series and the growth condition $\liminf a_n^{1/2^n} > 1$, and asks if the series is irrational for all such sequences.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
