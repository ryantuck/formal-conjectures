# Erdős Problem 1025 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $g(n)$ be such that, in every function $f$ from pairs to elements (avoiding identity), there is an independent set of size at least $g(n)$. Estimate $g(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1025.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`) inside the existential quantifier. It does not define the independence condition or the function $g(n)$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
