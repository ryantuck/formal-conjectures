# Erdős Problem 13 Review

## Problem Statement

If $A \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}$ is such that there are no $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a \mid (b + c)$ and $a < \min(b, c)$, then $|A| \leq N/3 + O(1)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/13.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_13` asks if `answer(True)` is equivalent to the upper bound $N/3 + C$. This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
