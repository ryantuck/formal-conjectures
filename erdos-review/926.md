# Erdős Problem 926 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 4$. Is it true that $\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k) \ll_k n^{3/2}$, where $H_k$ is the graph on vertices $x,y_1,\ldots,y_k,z_1,\ldots,z_{\binom{k}{2}}$, where $x$ is adjacent to all $y_i$ and each pair of $y_i,y_j$ is adjacent to a unique $z_i$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/926.lean`.

The definition `H_k_free` describes a forbidden subgraph structure involving $k$ disjoint paths of length $k+1$ (or similar).
This is completely different from the graph $H_k$ described in the problem (a subdivision of $K_k$ with a universal vertex connected to the base?). The description "each pair of $y_i,y_j$ is adjacent to a unique $z_i$" defines the 1-subdivision of $K_k$. The vertex $x$ is connected to all $y_i$.
The formalization does not capture this graph structure.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
