# Erdős Problem 1017 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n,k)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices and $k$ edges can be partitioned into at most $f(n,k)$ edge-disjoint complete graphs. Estimate $f(n,k)$ for $k>n^2/4$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1017.lean`.

The functions `cliquePartitionSize` and `f` are defined (though `f` uses `iSup` over graphs, which is valid in Lean noncomputably).
The conjecture `clique_partition_estimate` asks for the existence of an asymptotic approximation $g(n, k)$.
This seems to capture the "Estimate $f(n,k)$" requirement reasonably well.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
