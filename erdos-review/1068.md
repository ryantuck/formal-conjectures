# Erdős Problem 1068 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ contain a countable subgraph which is infinitely vertex-connected?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1068.lean`.

The formalization asks if for every graph $G$ with `G.chromaticNumber = aleph 1`, there exists a set of vertices $s$ such that `s.Countable` and the induced subgraph `G.induce s` is `InfinitelyConnected`.
This perfectly matches the problem statement asking for a "countable subgraph which is infinitely vertex-connected".

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
