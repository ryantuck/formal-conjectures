# Review of Erdos Problem 619

## Problem Statement
For connected triangle-free $G$, is $h_4(G) < (1-c)n$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for existence of $c$.

```lean
theorem h4_linear_improvement (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∃ c > 0, ... h_r 4 G < Nat.floor ((1 - c) * n)
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- $h_4(G)$ corresponds to `h_r 4 G`.
- Bound is correct.

## Confidence
100%
