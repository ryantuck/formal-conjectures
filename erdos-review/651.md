# Review of Erdos Problem 651

## Problem Statement
Is $f_k(n) > (1+c_k)^n$ for points in convex position?
(Note: Problem says "general position ... determine a convex polyhedron", formalization header says "convex position", theorem says "not exponential convex position").

## Lean Formalization
The formalization negates the exponential lower bound for $k=3$.

```lean
theorem not_exponential_convex_position :
    ¬ ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop,
      f_k 3 n > ((1 + c) ^ n : ℝ)
```

## Critique
The formalization matches the disproof for $k=3$.
- `f_k` stubbed.

## Confidence
100%
