**Problem:** Non-convergent interpolating polynomials

## Source Problem

For n ≥ 1, fix a sequence of n distinct numbers x_{1n}, ..., x_{nn} ∈ [-1,1]. Let ε = ε(n) → 0. Does there always exist a continuous function f: [-1,1] → ℝ such that if p_n is a sequence of polynomials with deg p_n < (1+ε(n))n, satisfying p_n(x_{kn}) = f(x_{kn}) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then p_n(x) does not converge to f(x) for almost all x ∈ [-1,1]?

Known: When ε > 0 is fixed (not → 0), Erdos-Kroó-Szabados showed there exist node sequences with uniform convergence for any continuous f.

## Critical Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Correct quantifier structure**: ∀ nodes, ∀ ε → 0, ∃ continuous f, ∀ interpolating polynomials p with the degree bound, non-convergence a.e. This matches the source.

2. **Correct use of nodes**: `nodes : (n : ℕ) → Fin n → ℝ` correctly models a triangular array of nodes (n nodes at step n).

3. **Correct distinctness condition**: `∀ n i j, i ≠ j → nodes n i ≠ nodes n j` ensures distinct nodes.

4. **Correct measure-theoretic conclusion**: `∃ᵐ x ∂(volume.restrict (Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1))` means "for a.e. x ∈ [-1,1]", which matches "for almost all x".

5. **Correct interpolation condition**: `(p n).eval (nodes n i) = f (nodes n i)` correctly states p_n interpolates f at the nodes.

### Issues

1. **Degree comparison type mismatch (MINOR)**: `(p n).natDegree` has type ℕ while `(1 + ε n) * n` has type ℝ. Lean coerces the ℕ to ℝ for the comparison, so this works, but the comparison `< : ℝ → ℝ → Prop` is being used on the cast. This is mathematically correct since natDegree ∈ ℕ and (1+ε(n))n ∈ ℝ.

2. **ε could be negative (MINOR)**: The source says ε(n) → 0, which allows ε(n) < 0 for some n. This means (1+ε(n))n < n for those n, making the degree bound stricter than deg < n. The source likely intends ε(n) > 0, i.e., allowing slightly MORE than n nodes. Adding `(∀ n, ε n > 0)` or `(∀ᶠ n in atTop, ε n > 0)` would be more faithful.

3. **Missing `answer(sorry) ↔` polarity note (MINOR)**: The problem asks "does there always exist..." which is a yes/no question. The use of `answer(sorry) ↔` is correct. The affirmative answer means "yes, such f always exists."

## Confidence: **55%**

This is one of the stronger formalizations in this batch. The quantifier structure, node model, degree bound, interpolation condition, and measure-theoretic conclusion all match the source well. The main weaknesses are the minor ε-sign issue and the type coercion in the degree comparison.
