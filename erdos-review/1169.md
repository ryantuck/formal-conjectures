# Review: Erdos Problem 1169

**File:** `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1169.lean`
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1169](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1169)
**Status:** OPEN (proved under CH by Hajnal)

## Original Problem

Is it true that, for all finite $k < \omega$, $\omega_1^2 \nrightarrow (\omega_1^2, 3)^2$?

This asks: does there exist a 2-coloring of pairs from $\omega_1^2$ such that:
- Color 0 has no monochromatic subset of order type $\omega_1^2$
- Color 1 has no monochromatic 3-element set

Hajnal proved this holds under CH.

## Current Formalization

```lean

    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (α : Type*) [Infinite α],
        ∃ (coloring : Finset α → Fin 2),

            ∃ (s : Finset α), s.card = 2 ∧ (↑s : Set α) ⊆ H ∧ coloring s ≠ 0) ∧
          (∀ (t : Finset α), t.card = 3 →
            ∃ (pair : Finset α), pair.card = 2 ∧ (↑pair : Set α) ⊆ (↑t : Set α) ∧
              coloring pair ≠ 1) := by

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry)` for open problem |
| 2-coloring | Yes | `Finset α → Fin 2` |
| No large monochromatic set in color 0 | Partially | Uses cardinality, not order type |
| No monochromatic triangle in color 1 | Yes | Correctly encoded |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 03]` |

### Critical issues

1. **Color 0 condition uses cardinality, not order type:** The first conjunct says: for every $H$ containing an injective copy of $\alpha$ (i.e., $|H| \geq |\alpha|$), there's a non-color-0 pair in $H$. This encodes "no monochromatic-0 set of cardinality $|\alpha|$." But the original asks for no monochromatic set of **order type** $\omega_1^2$, which is a stronger structural condition involving the ordering of ordinals.

2. **Self-injection is unusual:** The condition `∃ f : α → α, Function.Injective f ∧ Set.range f ⊆ H` means $H$ contains a copy of $\alpha$ (via injection from $\alpha$ to itself landing in $H$). This is equivalent to $|H| \geq |\alpha|$. While reasonable for cardinality-based conditions, it doesn't capture order-type conditions.

3. **No cardinality constraint for $\omega_1^2$:** `α` is universally quantified over all infinite types, not constrained to have the cardinality of $\omega_1^2$.

4. **Role of $k$ unclear:** The original mentions "for all finite $k < \omega$" but neither the source nor the formalization clarifies what role $k$ plays. The formalization notes this honestly.

### Good aspects

5. **Color 1 condition is well-formalized:** `∀ (t : Finset α), t.card = 3 → ∃ (pair : Finset α), pair.card = 2 ∧ ... ∧ coloring pair ≠ 1` correctly encodes: every 3-element set contains a pair NOT colored 1, i.e., no monochromatic triangle in color 1.

6. **The docstring is transparent** about limitations and the ambiguity around $k$.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 20%**

The color-1 condition (no monochromatic triangle) is correctly formalized. The color-0 condition captures "no large monochromatic set" by cardinality but not by order type. Missing the specific ordinal $\omega_1^2$ and the role of the parameter $k$.
