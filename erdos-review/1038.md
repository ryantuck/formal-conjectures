# Erdős Problem 1038 Review

## Problem Statement

Determine the infimum and supremum of $\lvert \{ x\in \mathbb{R} : \lvert f(x)vert < 1\}vert$ as $f\in \mathbb{R}[x]$ ranges over all non-constant monic polynomials, all of whose roots are real and in the interval $[-1,1]$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1038.lean`.

The problem is well-formalized using `Polynomial` and `MeasureTheory`.
The condition `(f.roots.filter ...).card = f.natDegree` correctly ensures all roots are real and in $[-1, 1]$.
The volume of the sublevel set is correctly expressed.
Specific bounds and results from Tao are included.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
