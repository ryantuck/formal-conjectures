# Review of Erdos Problem 618

## Problem Statement
If $G$ is triangle-free and max degree $o(\sqrt{n})$, is $h_2(G) = o(n^2)$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization tests the implication.

```lean
theorem small_degree_implies_small_h2 :
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ...
        (∀ v, (G.degree v : ℝ) ≤ δ * Real.sqrt n) →
        (h₂ G : ℝ) < ε * (n : ℝ) ^ 2
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- $o(\sqrt{n})$ captured by $\forall \epsilon \exists \delta$. Wait.
- $o(\sqrt{n})$ usually means $\lim \Delta(G_n)/\sqrt{n} = 0$.
- The formalization says: For every $\epsilon > 0$ (bound on $h_2$), there exists $\delta > 0$ (bound on degree) such that degree $\le \delta \sqrt{n}$ implies $h_2 < \epsilon n^2$.
- This is one way to formalize the asymptotic relationship. It says "small degree implies small $h_2$".
- Strictly speaking, the problem says "if G has max degree $o(\sqrt{n})$ then $h_2(G)=o(n^2)$".
- The formalization captures this uniform continuity/limit dependency.
