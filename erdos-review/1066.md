# Erdős Problem 1066 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a graph given by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where any two distinct points are at least distance $1$ apart, and we draw an edge between two points if they are distance $1$ apart. Let $g(n)$ be maximal such that any such graph always has an independent set on at least $g(n)$ vertices. Estimate $g(n)$, or perhaps $\lim \frac{g(n)}{n}$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1066.lean`.

The formalization is currently a placeholder (`sorry`). It starts to define a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ but does not proceed to define the unit distance graph or the function $g(n)$. The core logic is missing.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete. It essentially contains no formal statement of the problem.
