# Erdős Problem 138 Review

## Problem Statement

Asymptotics of Van der Waerden numbers $W(k)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/138.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_138` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to $(W(k))^{1/k} \to \infty$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
