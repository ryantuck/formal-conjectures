# Erdős Problem 1091 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a $K_4$-free graph with chromatic number $4$. Must $G$ contain an odd cycle with at least two diagonals?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1091.lean` is:
```lean
theorem odd_cycles_with_diagonals {n : ℕ} (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
      G.chromaticNumber = 4 →
      (∀ (K4 : Finset (Fin n)), K4.card = 4 →
        ∃ u ∈ K4, ∃ v ∈ K4, u ≠ v ∧ ¬G.Adj u v) →
      ∃ (C : List (Fin n)), C.length ≥ 5 ∧ Odd C.length ∧ sorry := by
  sorry
```
The formalization correctly captures the hypothesis ($G$ is $K_4$-free and $\chi(G)=4$). However, the conclusion regarding the odd cycle having "at least two diagonals" is missing and replaced by `sorry`.

## Completeness
The formalization is incomplete. The condition for the cycle having diagonals is not implemented.
