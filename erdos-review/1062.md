# Erdős Problem 1062 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be the size of the largest subset $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that there are no three distinct elements $a,b,c\in A$ such that $a\mid b$ and $a\mid c$. How large can $f(n)$ be? Is $\lim f(n)/n$ irrational?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1062.lean`.

The condition "no three distinct elements $a,b,c \in A$ such that $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$" is formalized as `ForkFree A`.
`def ForkFree (A : Set ℕ) : Prop := ∀ a ∈ A, ({b | b ∈ A \ {a} ∧ a ∣ b} : Set ℕ).Subsingleton`
This definition states that for any element $a \in A$, the set of other elements in $A$ divisible by $a$ has at most one element. This is logically equivalent to the problem statement: if there were two distinct elements $b, c \in A \setminus \{a\}$ divisible by $a$, then $\{a, b, c\}$ would be three distinct elements satisfying the condition.

The function $f(n)$ is formalized as the maximum cardinality of such a subset of $\{1, \dots, n\}$.

The question "Is $\lim f(n)/n$ irrational?" is formalized as `erdos_1062.limit_density`, which asks if the limit exists and is irrational.
