## Original Problem

Let $\kappa$ be an uncountable cardinal. Must there exist a cardinal $\lambda$ such that every graph with chromatic number $\lambda$ contains a triangle-free subgraph with chromatic number $\kappa$?

Shelah proved the consistency of a negative answer when $\kappa = \lambda = \aleph_1$.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem triangle_free_subgraph_chromatic :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∀ (kappa_type : Type*) [Infinite kappa_type],
        ∃ (lambda_type : Type*),
          ∀ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V),
            ∃ (H : SimpleGraph V), H ≤ G ∧
              (∀ (tri : Finset V), tri.card = 3 → ¬H.IsClique (tri : Set V)) := by
  sorry
```

## Analysis

### What the formalization captures

| Aspect | Captured? | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Question format | Yes | `answer(sorry) ↔` |
| Triangle-free subgraph | Yes | `H ≤ G` and `¬H.IsClique` for 3-sets |
| Subgraph relation | Yes | `H ≤ G` correctly encodes H is a subgraph |
| Category/AMS tag | Yes | `@[category research open, AMS 03]` |

### Critical issues

1. **Trivially true (Critical):** The statement is trivially satisfied. For any graph G, take H to be the empty graph (no edges). Then `H ≤ G` holds (the empty graph is a subgraph of everything), and H is vacuously triangle-free. The existential `∃ (H : SimpleGraph V)` is always satisfiable regardless of G.

2. **Chromatic number of G missing (Critical):** The original requires G to have chromatic number $\lambda$. The formalization has `∀ (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V)` with no constraint on G's chromatic number. Without this hypothesis, the statement says nothing about graphs with large chromatic number.

3. **Chromatic number of H missing (Critical):** The original requires the triangle-free subgraph to have chromatic number $\kappa$. The formalization only requires H to be triangle-free, with no chromatic number constraint. This is the other half of the problem's substance.

4. **kappa_type and lambda_type are disconnected:** These types appear in the quantifier structure but have no relationship to the chromatic numbers of G or H. They serve no mathematical purpose in the current formulation.

### Minor issues

5. **lambda_type is existentially quantified but unused:** The `∃ (lambda_type : Type*)` introduces a type that never constrains anything in the subsequent formula.

## Verdict

**Confidence: 5%**

The formalization is trivially true. The entire mathematical content of the problem — chromatic number constraints on both G and H — is absent. The triangle-free subgraph condition is correctly stated but meaningless without the chromatic number requirements. Taking H as the empty graph satisfies the statement for any G.
