# Review of Erdos Problem 560

## Problem Statement
Determine $\hat{R}(K_{n,n})$, the size Ramsey number for the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$.
Known: $(1/60)n^2 2^n < \hat{R}(K_{n,n}) < (3/2)n^3 2^n$.
Conjectured: $\hat{R}(K_{n,n}) \asymp n^3 2^n$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `size_ramsey_complete_bipartite_bounds` as `True`.
It defines `size_ramsey_knn_conjecture` as `answer(sorry) ↔ sorry`.

```lean
theorem size_ramsey_complete_bipartite_bounds (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 6) :
    True := by
  trivial

theorem size_ramsey_knn_conjecture :
    answer(sorry) ↔ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The size Ramsey number $\hat{R}(K_{n,n})$ is not defined.
- The bounds and conjecture are not expressed.
