# Review of Erdos Problem 584

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $\delta n^2$ edges. Determine whether $G$ must contain:
(a) a subgraph $H_1$ with $\gg \delta^3 n^2$ edges where every two edges lie on a cycle of length $\le 6$. Furthermore, if two edges share a vertex, they are on a cycle of length 4.
(b) a subgraph $H_2$ with $\gg \delta^2 n^2$ edges where every two edges lie on a cycle of length $\le 8$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization has two parts.

```lean
theorem dense_graph_short_cycles_part_a ...
        (∀ e₁ e₂ : Fin n × Fin n, H.Adj e₁.1 e₁.2 → H.Adj e₂.1 e₂.2 →
          ∃ (w : H.Walk e₁.1 e₁.1), w.length ≤ 6 ∧ sorry)

theorem dense_graph_short_cycles_part_b ...
          ∃ (w : H.Walk e₁.1 e₁.1), w.length ≤ 8
```

## Critique
- Part (a): The condition "if two edges share a vertex they are on a cycle of length 4" is missing (replaced by `sorry`).
- Part (b): Captures the condition "every two edges lie on a cycle of length $\le 8$".
- The formalization for (a) is incomplete.

## Confidence
50% (Part (a) is incomplete)
