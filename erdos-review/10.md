# Erdős Problem 10 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there some $k$ such that every integer is the sum of a prime and at most $k$ powers of $2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/10.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_10` asks if there exists a $k$ such that the set of sums (prime + $\le k$ powers of 2) equals all integers (excluding 0, 1). This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
