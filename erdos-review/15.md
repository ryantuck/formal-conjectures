# Erdős Problem 15 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{n}{p_n}$ converges?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/15.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_15` asks if `answer(sorry)` is equivalent to the summability of the alternating series. This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
