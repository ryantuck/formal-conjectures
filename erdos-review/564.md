# Review of Erdos Problem 564

## Problem Statement
Let $R_3(n)$ be the $3$-uniform hypergraph Ramsey number. Is there some constant $c>0$ such that $R_3(n) \geq 2^{2^{cn}}$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of such a $c$.

```lean

    ∃ c > 0, ∀ᶠ n in atTop, (2 : ℝ)^(2 : ℝ)^(c * n) ≤ hypergraphRamsey 3 n := by

```

## Critique
The formalization captures the problem exactly.
- `hypergraphRamsey 3 n` corresponds to $R_3(n)$.
- The double exponential lower bound is correctly expressed.
- `∀ᶠ n in atTop` handles the asymptotic nature (implied by "such that" often meaning for large n, or if it holds for all n, the asymptotic version is usually what's interesting/meant in these growth problems).
