# Erdős Problem 1015 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(t)$ be minimal such that, in any two-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, the edges can be partitioned into vertex disjoint monochromatic copies of $K_t$ with at most $f(t)$ vertices remaining. Estimate $f(t)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1015.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`) inside the existential quantifier for the clique partition property, and it does not define $f(t)$ or the estimation goal.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
