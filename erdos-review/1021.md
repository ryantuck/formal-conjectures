# Erdős Problem 1021 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for every $k\geq 3$, there is a constant $c_k>0$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,G_k) \ll n^{3/2-c_k}$, where $G_k$ is the bipartite graph between $\{y_1,\ldots,y_k\}$ and $\{z_1,\ldots,z_{\binom{k}{2}}\}$, with each $z_j$ joined to a unique pair of $y_i$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1021.lean`.

The formalization uses a condition `(∀ H : SimpleGraph α, H ≤ G → ∃ m, m ≠ k)`. This does not define the graph $G_k$ (which corresponds to a subdivision of $K_k$). It seems to be a placeholder or a misinterpretation. The structure of $G_k$ is specific and crucial.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
