# Review of Erdos Problem 647

## Problem Statement
Is there $n > 24$ such that $\max_{m < n} (m + \tau(m)) \le n+2$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks this question.

```lean
theorem erdos_647 : answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ n > 24, ⨆ m : Fin n, m + σ 0 m ≤ n + 2
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `σ 0 m` is the divisor count function $\tau(m)$.
- `⨆ m : Fin n` captures $\max_{m < n}$.

## Confidence
100%
