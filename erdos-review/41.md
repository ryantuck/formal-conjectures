# Erdős Problem 41 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A \subseteq ℕ$ be infinite with distinct triple sums. Is it true that $\liminf |A \cap \{1, \dots, N\}| / N^{1/3} = 0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/41.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_41` asserts the limit is 0. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
