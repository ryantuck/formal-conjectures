# Erdős Problem 56 Review

## Problem Statement

Is the set of multiples of the first $k$ primes the largest $k$-weakly divisible subset of $\{1,\dots,N\}$?

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/56.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_56` asks if this maximality holds (equating it to `answer(False)`). Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence
