# Erdős Problem 998 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $\alpha$ be irrational. If $\#\{ 1\leq m\leq n : \{ \alpha m\} \in [u,v)\} = n(v-u)+O(1)$ then are $u, v$ in $\{\alpha k\}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/998.lean`.

The theorem `equidistribution_endpoint_condition` uses the hypothesis: `Tendsto (count / N) atTop (nhds (v-u))`.
This is the condition for *equidistribution* (error $o(N)$), not the much stronger condition of bounded error ($O(1)$).
The conclusion is that endpoints are fractional parts.
This formalization asserts that mere equidistribution implies endpoints are special, which is false. The bounded remainder condition is key.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
