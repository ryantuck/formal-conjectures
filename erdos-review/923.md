# Erdős Problem 923 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that, for every $k$, there is some $f(k)$ such that if $G$ has chromatic number $\geq f(k)$ then $G$ contains a triangle-free subgraph with chromatic number $\geq k$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/923.lean`.

The formalization `triangle_free_chromatic` states: "If G contains a dense triangle-free subgraph H, then G has bounded chromatic number".
This is the reverse or logical inverse of the problem statement (which asks if high chromatic number implies existence of high chromatic triangle-free subgraph).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
