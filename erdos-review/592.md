# Review of Erdos Problem 592

## Problem Statement
Determine which countable ordinals $\beta$ have the property that if $\alpha = \omega^\beta$, then in any red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_\alpha$ there is either a red $K_\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization sets up the equivalence for the property.

```lean
theorem erdos_592 (β : Ordinal.{u}) : β.card ≤ ℵ₀ →
    OrdinalCardinalRamsey (ω ^ β) (ω ^ β) 3 ↔ (answer(sorry) : Ordinal.{u} → Prop) β := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization correctly sets up the "Determine" problem structure.

## Confidence
