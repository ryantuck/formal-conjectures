# Erdős Problem 14 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $B$ be the set of integers representable in exactly one way as sum of two elements from $A$. Is it true that for $\epsilon > 0$, $|\{1..N\} \setminus B| \gg N^{1/2 - \epsilon}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/14.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_14a` formalizes this question correctly using `nonUniqueSumCount`.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
