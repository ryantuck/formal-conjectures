# Review of Erdos Problem 634

## Problem Statement
Find all $n$ such that some triangle can be cut into $n$ congruent triangles.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the set $S$ of such $n$.

```lean
theorem triangle_dissection_numbers :
    ∃ S : Set ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, (∃ T : Set (Fin 2 → ℝ), CanBeCutInto T n) ↔ n ∈ S := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.

## Confidence
100%
