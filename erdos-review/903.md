# Erdős Problem 903 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $n=p^2+p+1$ for some prime power $p$, and let $A_1,\ldots,A_t\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a block design (so that every pair $x,y\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one $A_i$). Is it true that if $t>n$ then $t\geq n+p$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/903.lean`.

The theorem `block_design_prime_bound` states `t > n → t ≥ n + p`.
Crucially, it **does not** include the hypothesis that a block design of size $t$ exists on $n$ elements.
As written, it asserts that for any natural number $t$, if $t > n$ then $t \ge n+p$, which is false (e.g. $t=n+1$ if $p>1$).

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
