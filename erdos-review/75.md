# Erdős Problem 75 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a graph with $\chi(G)=\aleph_1$ such that finite subgraphs have large independent sets?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/75.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_75` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this existence. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
