# Erdős Problem 919 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a graph $G$ with vertex set $\omega_2^2$ and chromatic number $\aleph_2$ such that every subgraph whose vertices have a lesser type has chromatic number $\leq \aleph_0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/919.lean`.

The formalization uses `SimpleGraph (ℕ × ℕ)`, which has a countable vertex set ($\aleph_0$).
The problem requires a vertex set of size $\aleph_2$ (or specific ordinal type $\omega_2^2$).
The graph properties are defined on a countable set, which contradicts the problem constraints.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
