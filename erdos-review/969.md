# Erdős Problem 969 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $Q(x)$ count the number of squarefree integers in $[1,x]$. Determine the order of magnitude in the error term in the asymptotic $Q(x)=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x+E(x)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/969.lean`.

The definitions of `Q` and `squarefree_error_term` are placeholders (`sorry`).
The theorem statement is incomplete.

## Completeness
