# Erdős Problem 1004 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $c>0$. If $x$ is sufficiently large then does there exist $n\leq x$ such that the values of $\phi(n+k)$ are all distinct for $1\leq k\leq (\log x)^c$, where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1004.lean`.

The predicate `IsDistinctTotientRun` correctly captures the distinctness condition.
The theorem `erdos_1004` correctly formalizes the problem statement using asymptotic filters.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
