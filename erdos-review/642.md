# Review of Erdos Problem 642

## Problem Statement
For graphs where all cycles have more vertices than chords, is the max number of edges $f(n) \ll n$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks if $f(n) \ll n$.

```lean
noncomputable def f (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem cycles_more_vertices_than_chords ... (f n : ℝ) < ε * n
```

## Critique
The definition of `f` is stubbed, so the condition "cycles have more vertices than chords" is hidden.
Logic for $\ll n$ is correct.

## Confidence
90% (Stub definition)
