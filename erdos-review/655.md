# Review of Erdos Problem 655

## Problem Statement
No circle centered at $x_i$ contains 3 other points. Distinct distances $\ge (1+c)n/2$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks this.

```lean
theorem distinct_distances_circle_constraint ...
        (∀ x ∈ A, sorry) →
        sorry ≥ Nat.floor ((1 + c) * n / 2)
```

## Critique
The formalization is a skeleton (`sorry` conditions).

## Confidence
50% (Skeleton)
