# Erdős Problem 1002 Review

## Problem Statement

For any $0<\alpha<1$, let $f(\alpha,n)=\frac{1}{\log n}\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}(	frac{1}{2}-\{ \alpha k\})$. Does $f(\alpha,n)$ have an asymptotic distribution function?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1002.lean`.

The function `f` is correctly defined.
The conjecture `fractional_sum_distribution` asks for the existence of a distribution function $g$ such that the measure of $\alpha$ where $f(\alpha, n) \le x$ tends to $g(x)$.
However, the formalization uses `Tendsto (fun α => μ α) atTop (nhds (g x))` where `μ` is existentially quantified but not defined in relation to the measure of the set. It looks like a garbled attempt to express convergence in distribution. It does not correctly express the limit of the measure of the set $\{ \alpha \in (0,1) : f(\alpha, n) \le c \}$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect/incomplete.
