# Erdős Problem 907 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f:\mathbb{R}	o \mathbb{R}$ be such that $f(x+h)-f(x)$ is continous for every $h>0$. Is it true that $f=g+h$ for some continuous $g$ and additive $h$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/907.lean`.

The hypothesis `∀ x y : ℝ, Continuous (fun z => f (x + z) - f z)` interprets the problem as: for every $x$, the function $z \mapsto f(x+z)-f(z)$ is continuous.
The problem statement "for every $h>0$" usually implies checking the function $x \mapsto f(x+h)-f(x)$.
Standard interpretation of $\Delta_h f$ being continuous refers to continuity in $x$.
The formalization checks continuity in the shift/difference variable $z$ (or $h$), which is a different property.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect (wrong interpretation of continuity condition).
