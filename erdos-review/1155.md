# Review: Erdos Problem 1155

**Problem:** Random triangle deletion process
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1155](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1155)
**Status:** OPEN (substantially addressed by Bohman-Frieze-Lubetzky 2015)

## Source Problem

Beginning with the complete graph K_n, repeatedly select a uniformly random triangle and delete all its edges until the graph becomes triangle-free. If f(n) denotes the remaining edge count, is it true that f(n) = n^{3/2+o(1)} almost surely?

Known: Grable (1997) showed P(f(n) > n^{7/4+ε}) → 0. Bohman, Frieze, Lubetzky (2015) proved f(n) = n^{3/2+o(1)} a.s.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem random_triangle_deletion_edges :
    answer(True) ↔
      ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
      ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ), ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
        (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) - ε) ≤ f n ∧ f n ≤ (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) + ε) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Statement is trivially true (CRITICAL)

`∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ)` is existentially quantified, so we can simply define f(n) = ⌊n^{3/2}⌋. Then for any ε > 0 and large n:
- n^{3/2-ε} ≤ ⌊n^{3/2}⌋ (for large n)
- ⌊n^{3/2}⌋ ≤ n^{3/2+ε} (trivially)

The statement is provable without any reference to random graphs, triangle deletion, or probability. The `answer(True)` is correct but for the wrong reason — it's true because of the existential, not because of the mathematics.

### 2. Entirely missing: the random process (CRITICAL)

The problem is about a specific stochastic process:
1. Start with K_n
2. Choose a uniformly random triangle
3. Delete all three edges
4. Repeat until no triangles remain

None of this appears in the formalization. The function f(n) should be a random variable representing the edge count after the process terminates, not an arbitrary function.

### 3. Missing: probability (CRITICAL)

The statement "f(n) = n^{3/2+o(1)} almost surely" means: for all ε > 0,

  P(n^{3/2-ε} < f(n) < n^{3/2+ε}) → 1 as n → ∞

This requires a probability space and measure. The formalization has no probabilistic content whatsoever.

### 4. The exponent 3/2 is correct (MINOR POSITIVE)

The exponent 3/2 from Bohman-Frieze-Lubetzky does appear correctly.

### 5. answer(True) is reasonable

Given that the result has been proved (BFL 2015), marking it as solved is appropriate — but the formalized statement should capture what was actually proved.

## What a proper formalization would need

This problem genuinely requires substantial probability infrastructure:
- Definition of the random triangle deletion process as a Markov chain
- The probability space of random graph sequences
- Almost sure convergence

A minimal placeholder might define the random variable f as sorry and state the probabilistic conclusion:

```lean
/-- The number of edges remaining after the random triangle deletion
    process on K_n terminates. -/
noncomputable def triangleDeletionEdges : ℕ → MeasureTheory.Measure ℕ := sorry

theorem random_triangle_deletion_edges :
    answer(True) ↔
      ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 →
        ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop,
          triangleDeletionEdges n {k | (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) - ε) ≤ k ∧
            k ≤ (n : ℝ)^((3/2 : ℝ) + ε)} = 1 := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **3%**

The exponent 3/2 appears, and answer(True) is appropriate for the solved status. But the statement is trivially true due to the unconstrained existential, and the entire probabilistic content of the problem is absent.
