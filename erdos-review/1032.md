# Erdős Problem 1032 Review

## Problem Statement

We say that a graph is $4$-chromatic critical if it has chromatic number $4$, and removing any edge decreases the chromatic number to $3$. Is there, for arbitrarily large $n$, a $4$-chromatic critical graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree $\gg n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1032.lean`.

The formalization correctly captures:
- Chromatic number 4: `G.chromaticNumber = 4`
- Criticality: `∀ e : Sym2 (Fin n), (G.deleteEdges {e}).chromaticNumber < 4`
- Minimum degree condition: `G.degree v ≥ c * n`

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
