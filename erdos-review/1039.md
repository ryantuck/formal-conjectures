# Erdős Problem 1039 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\in \mathbb{C}[z]$ with $\lvert z_ivert \leq 1$ for all $i$. Let $ho(f)$ be the radius of the largest disc which is contained in $\{z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}$. Determine the behaviour of $ho(f)$. In particular, is it always true that $ho(f)\gg 1/n$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1039.lean`.

The function `ρ` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
