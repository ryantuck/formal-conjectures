# Review of Erdos Problem 598

## Problem Statement
Let $m$ be an infinite cardinal and $\kappa = (2^{\aleph_0})^+$. Can one colour the countable subsets of $m$ using $\kappa$ many colours so that every $X \subseteq m$ with $|X| = \kappa$ contains subsets of all possible colours?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization captures the coloring property.

```lean
theorem erdos_598 : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∃ c : { s : Set m // s.Countable } → κ.out,
    ∀ X : Set m, #X = κ →
    c '' { s : { sub : Set m // sub.Countable } | s.1 ⊆ X } = Set.univ := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `c` maps countable subsets to colors ($\kappa$).
- `∀ X` of size $\kappa$, the image of subsets of `X` under `c` is the universe of colors (all colors).
