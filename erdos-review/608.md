# Review of Erdos Problem 608

## Problem Statement
For graph with $> n^2/4$ edges, must at least $(2/9)n^2$ edges be contained in a $C_5$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization negates the claim (as it's disproved).

```lean
theorem not_two_ninths_edges_in_c5 :
    ¬ ∀ (n : ℕ) (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
      G.edgeSet.ncard > n^2 / 4 →
      sorry ≥ 2 * n^2 / 9 := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization uses `sorry` for the "edges in $C_5$" quantity.
- The structure is correct.
- `sorry ≥ ...` is a placeholder for the quantity.

## Confidence
90% (Stub quantity)
