# Erdős Problem 1060 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ count the number of solutions to $k\sigma(k)=n$, where $\sigma(k)$ is the sum of divisors of $k$. Is it true that $f(n)\leq n^{o(\frac{1}{\log\log n})}$? Perhaps even $\leq (\log n)^{O(1)}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1060.lean`.

The function $f(n)$ is formalized as `#{k ≤ n | k * σ 1 k = n}`. This correctly counts the number of integers $k$ such that $k\sigma(k) = n$. The constraint $k \le n$ is naturally satisfied since $\sigma(k) \ge 1$.

The first bound $f(n)\leq n^{o(\frac{1}{\log\log n})}$ is formalized as:
`∃ h : ℕ → ℝ, h =o[atTop] (fun n ↦ 1 / log (log n)) ∧ ∀ᶠ n in atTop, #{k ≤ n | k * σ 1 k = n} ≤ (n : ℝ) ^ h n`
This correctly expresses that there exists a function $h(n)$ which is little-o of $1/\log\log n$ such that $f(n) \le n^{h(n)}$ for sufficiently large $n$.

The second bound $f(n) \leq (\log n)^{O(1)}$ is formalized as:
`∃ (C : ℝ), (fun n ↦ (#{k ≤ n | k * σ 1 k = n} : ℝ)) =O[atTop] (fun n ↦ log n ^ C)`
This correctly expresses that $f(n)$ is big-O of some power of $\log n$.

## Completeness

The formalization captures the problem statement accurately. The use of asymptotic filters (`atTop`) and Little-o/Big-O notation is appropriate for the problem.
