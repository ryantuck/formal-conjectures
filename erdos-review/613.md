# Review of Erdos Problem 613

## Problem Statement
Graph with specific edge count decomposes into bipartite + max degree < n?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization negates the decomposition.

```lean
theorem not_bipartite_decomposition :
    ¬ ∀ (n : ℕ) ...
      G.edgeSet.ncard = Nat.choose (2*n+1) 2 - Nat.choose n 2 - 1 →
      ∃ (B D : SimpleGraph (Fin n)),
        IsBipartite B ∧
        (∀ v [DecidableRel D.Adj], D.degree v < n) ∧
        sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- Edge count matches.
- Decomposition target matches.
- `sorry` at end likely `G = B ⊔ D` (edge disjoint union or just union).

## Confidence
90% (Decomposition relation stubbed)
