# Erdős Problem 1034 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with $>n^2/4$ many edges. Must there be a triangle $T$ in $G$ and vertices $y_1,\ldots,y_t$, where $t>(\frac{1}{2}-o(1))n$, such that every vertex is joined to at least two vertices of $T$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1034.lean`.

The formalization counts vertices $x$ such that `G.Adj x u ∨ G.Adj x v ∨ G.Adj x w`.
This condition means $x$ is joined to *at least one* vertex of the triangle $\{u,v,w\}$.
The problem requires $x$ to be joined to *at least two* vertices of $T$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
