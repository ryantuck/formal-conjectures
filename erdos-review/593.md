# Review of Erdos Problem 593

## Problem Statement
Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear as subhypergraphs in every 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number greater than $\aleph_0$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines the set $S$ of such graphs.

```lean
theorem characterize_finite_three_uniform_in_uncountable :
    ∃ (S : Set (ThreeUniformHypergraph ℕ)),
      ∀ (H : ThreeUniformHypergraph ℕ), H ∈ S ↔
        (Finite H.edges ∧
         ∀ (K : ThreeUniformHypergraph (Ordinal.{0})),
           chromaticNumber K > aleph0 →
           ∃ (f : ℕ ↪ Ordinal.{0}), sorry) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the characterization problem.
- `chromaticNumber K > aleph0`: Uncountable chromatic number.
- `∃ f, ...`: Embedding (subgraph).
- The `sorry` in the embedding condition likely stands for preserving edges (subgraph definition).

## Confidence
90% (Embedding condition stubbed)
