# Review of Erdos Problem 595

## Problem Statement
Is there an infinite graph $G$ that contains no $K_4$ and cannot be expressed as the union of countably many triangle-free graphs?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of such a graph.

```lean
theorem infinite_k4_free_not_countable_union_triangle_free (answer : Prop) :
    answer ↔ ∃ (G : SimpleGraph ℕ),
      (Infinite ℕ) ∧
      (∀ (f : Fin 4 ↪ ℕ), ¬ ∀ i j, i ≠ j → G.Adj (f i) (f j)) ∧
      (¬ ∃ (family : ℕ → SimpleGraph ℕ),
        (∀ n, IsTriangleFree (family n)) ∧
        (∀ v w, G.Adj v w → ∃ n, (family n).Adj v w)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is precise.
- "Infinite": `Infinite ℕ` (graph on N).
- "contains no $K_4$": Correctly formalized.
- "not union of countably many triangle-free": Correctly formalized (`¬ ∃ family ...`).
