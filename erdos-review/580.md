# Review of Erdos Problem 580

## Problem Statement
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices such that at least $n/2$ vertices have degree at least $n/2$. Must $G$ contain every tree on at most $n/2$ vertices?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of an embedding for any tree $T$ with $|V(T)| \le n/2$.

```lean
theorem degree_condition_contains_trees :
    ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in Filter.atTop, ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
      (Finset.univ.filter (fun v => G.degree v ≥ n / 2)).card ≥ n / 2 →
      ∀ (T : SimpleGraph β) [Fintype β] (hT : IsTree T) (hcard : Fintype.card β ≤ n / 2),
        ∃ (f : β ↪ Fin n), ∀ i j, T.Adj i j ↔ G.Adj (f i) (f j) := by

## Critique
The formalization is generally correct.
- The condition "at least n/2 vertices have degree at least n/2" is correctly captured.
- The conclusion "contains every tree on at most n/2 vertices" is captured by the embedding `f`.
- Note: The embedding uses `↔` which implies *induced* subgraph. Usually "contains a tree" means as a subgraph (not necessarily induced). Given trees are sparse, induced containment is a much stronger condition (and often false in dense graphs unless the tree is a path or star). However, in extremely dense graphs (like Dirac's condition), we might look for subgraphs.
- Since the condition is on degrees, and we want to find *any* tree, we are likely looking for a subgraph.
- If it meant subgraph, it should be `→` instead of `↔`.
- Given the problem context (Dirac-type conditions often guarantee subgraphs), `↔` is likely too strong and thus incorrect.

## Confidence
80% (Potential subgraph vs induced mismatch)
