# Erdős Problem 948 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a function $f(n)$ and a $k$ such that in any $k$-colouring of the integers there exists a sequence $a_1<\cdots$ such that $a_n<f(n)$ and the set of finite subset sums does not contain all colours?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/948.lean`.

The formalization `coloring_subset_sums` asks if there exists a sequence such that `¬ ∀ S T ... c(sum S) = c(sum T)`.
This means "NOT (all subset sums have same color)" i.e. "subset sums are NOT monochromatic".
The problem asks for "set of subset sums does not contain all colours".
This means "Range(subset sums) $
eq$ All Colors".
These are equivalent only if $k=2$. For $k>2$, "not monochromatic" is a very weak condition (could use 2 colors out of $k$), while "does not contain all colors" is a strong condition (must miss at least one).
The formalization effectively asks: "Can we find a sequence whose subset sums are not monochromatic?".
The problem effectively asks: "Can we find a sequence whose subset sums miss a color?".
This is likely a misunderstanding of "does not contain all colours".

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
