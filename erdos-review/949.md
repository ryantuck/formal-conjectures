# Erdős Problem 949 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $S\subset \mathbb{R}$ be a set containing no solutions to $a+b=c$. Must there be a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}\backslash S$ of cardinality continuum such that $A+A\subseteq \mathbb{R}\backslash S$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/949.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_949` correctly captures the sum-free nature of $S$ and the existence of a continuum-sized $A$ in the complement with sumset also in the complement.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
