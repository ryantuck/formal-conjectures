# Erdős Problem 1088 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_d(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that any set of $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains a set of $n$ points such that any two determined distances are distinct. Estimate $f_d(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1088.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`). It does not define the function $f_d(n)$ or the distinct distances condition for the subset.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
