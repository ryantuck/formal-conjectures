# Review: Erdos Problem 1110

**Problem:** Representability using sums of powers of coprime integers
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1110](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1110)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let p > q >= 2 be coprime integers. An integer n is "representable" if it equals a sum of integers of the form p^k * q^l where no summand divides another. Erdos and Lewin proved that finitely many non-representable numbers exist if and only if {p,q} = {2,3}. For other coprime pairs, the question is about the density of non-representable numbers and whether infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers exist.

Yu and Chen established that representable numbers have density zero for q > 3, or q = 3 with p > 6, or q = 2 with p > 10.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem coprime_power_representation :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ a b k : ℕ,
      Nat.Coprime a b ∧ n = a^k + b^k := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Completely wrong problem statement (CRITICAL)

The formalization asks whether every natural number can be written as a^k + b^k with gcd(a,b) = 1. This is an entirely different problem from the source, which is about representing integers as sums of terms of the form p^k * q^l (products of powers of two fixed coprime bases p, q) where no summand divides another.

The source problem involves:
- Two fixed coprime integers p > q >= 2
- Sums of terms of the form p^k * q^l (not a^k + b^k)
- An antichain condition: no summand divides another
- Questions about the density of non-representable numbers

### 2. Wrong mathematical objects (CRITICAL)

The formalization uses a^k + b^k (a sum of two perfect powers), while the source uses sums of terms p^k * q^l (products of powers of two fixed bases). These are fundamentally different sets.

### 3. Missing antichain condition (CRITICAL)

The source requires that in the representation, no summand divides another. This antichain/incomparability condition is entirely absent.

### 4. Missing the fixed coprime pair (CRITICAL)

The source problem is parameterized by a specific coprime pair {p,q}. The formalization instead allows arbitrary coprime pairs (a,b) to vary with each n.

### 5. Wrong question being asked (CRITICAL)

The source asks about density of non-representable numbers (or whether infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers exist). The formalization asks a yes/no question about whether ALL numbers are representable, but even this yes/no framing does not match the actual problem.

### 6. Trivially true as stated (CRITICAL)

The formalized statement is trivially true. For any n, choose a = n, b = 0, k = 1: Nat.Coprime n 0 holds when n = 1 (since gcd(1,0) = 1), and more generally one can take a = n-1, b = 1, k = 1 giving n = (n-1)^1 + 1^1 with gcd(n-1,1) = 1. So the RHS is trivially satisfied.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- A term of the form p^k * q^l -/
def pqTerm (p q : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  {n | ∃ k l : ℕ, n = p ^ k * q ^ l}

/-- A number is representable if it is a sum of elements from pqTerm
    such that no summand divides another -/
def Representable (p q : ℕ) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), (↑S ⊆ pqTerm p q) ∧
    (∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, a ≠ b → ¬(a ∣ b)) ∧
    S.sum id = n

/-- For coprime p > q >= 2 with {p,q} != {2,3},
    the set of non-representable numbers is infinite -/
theorem coprime_power_representation (p q : ℕ) (hq : 2 ≤ q) (hp : q < p)
    (hcop : Nat.Coprime p q) (hne : ¬({p, q} = {2, 3} ∨ {p, q} = {3, 2})) :
    {n : ℕ | ¬Representable p q n}.Infinite := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization bears essentially no resemblance to the source problem. Every aspect is wrong: the mathematical objects, the quantifier structure, the conditions, and the question being asked. The statement is also trivially true.
