# Erdős Problem 1018 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $\epsilon>0$. Is there a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that, for all large $n$, every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n^{1+\epsilon}$ edges must contain a subgraph on at most $C_\epsilon$ vertices which is non-planar?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1018.lean`.

The predicate `IsPlanar` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem `nonplanar_subgraph` correctly expresses the problem statement, contingent on the definition of `IsPlanar`.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete due to `IsPlanar` being undefined.

## Confidence
