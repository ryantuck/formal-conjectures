# Erdős Problem 906 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there an entire non-zero function $f:\mathbb{C}	o \mathbb{C}$ such that, for any infinite sequence $n_1<n_2<\cdots$, the set $\{ z: f^{(n_k)}(z)=0 	extrm{ for some }k\geq 1\}$ is everywhere dense?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/906.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_906` asks for the existence of a transcendental entire function $f$ satisfying the property.
The condition "everywhere dense" is formalized using `Dense`.
The set definition `{ z | ∃ k, iteratedDeriv (n k) f z = 0 }` matches the zero set of derivatives in the subsequence.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence
