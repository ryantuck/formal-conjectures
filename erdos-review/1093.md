# Erdős Problem 1093 Review

## Problem Statement
For $n\geq 2k$ we define the deficiency of $\binom{n}{k}$ as follows. If $\binom{n}{k}$ is divisible by a prime $p\leq k$ then the deficiency is undefined. Otherwise, the deficiency is the number of $0\leq i<k$ such that $n-i$ is $k$-smooth, that is, divisible only by primes $\leq k$.

1. Are there infinitely many binomial coefficients with deficiency $1$?
2. Are there only finitely many with deficiency $>1$?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1093.lean` defines deficiency as:
```lean
noncomputable def deficiency (n k : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  #{i ∈ range k | n - i ∈ smoothNumbers k}
```
This correctly counts the number of terms $n-i$ (for $0 \le i < k$) that are $k$-smooth.

The conjectures are formalized using set comprehensions:
```lean
theorem erdos_1093.parts.i :
    answer(sorry) ↔ {x : ℕ × ℕ | let k := x.1; let n := x.2; 2 * k ≤ n ∧ deficiency n k = 1 ∧
      ∀ p, p.Prime → (p ∣ choose n k) → k < p}.Infinite

theorem erdos_1093.parts.ii :
    {x : ℕ × ℕ | let k := x.1; let n := x.2; 2 * k ≤ n ∧ deficiency n k > 1 ∧
      ∀ p, p.Prime → (p ∣ choose n k) → k < p}.Finite
```
The condition `∀ p, p.Prime → (p ∣ choose n k) → k < p` correctly enforces that $\binom{n}{k}$ is not divisible by any prime $p \le k$ (i.e., all prime factors are $> k$). This matches the "deficiency is undefined" clause by excluding such cases from the set. The questions of infinitude and finiteness are then asked on these sets.

## Completeness
The formalization is complete and faithful to the problem statement.

## Confidence
100%
