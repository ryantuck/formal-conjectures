# Erdős Problem 12 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A$ be an infinite set such that there are no distinct $a,b,c \in A$ such that $a \mid (b+c)$ and $b,c > a$. Is there such an $A$ with $\liminf \frac{|A \cap \{1, \dotsc, N\}|}{N^{1/2}} > 0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/12.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_12.parts.i` defines `IsGood` sets based on the divisibility condition and asks if `answer(sorry)` is equivalent to the existence of a set with positive liminf density scaled by $N^{1/2}$. This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
