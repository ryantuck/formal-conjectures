# Erdős Problem 1020 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n;r,k)$ be the maximal number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph which contains no set of $k$ many independent edges. Determine $f(n;r,k)$ for $r\ge 3$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1020.lean`.

The function `matchingNumber` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.
