# Review: Erdos Problem 1124

**Problem:** Decomposition of square and circle into congruent parts (Tarski's circle-squaring)
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1124](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1124)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Can a square and a circle of the same area be decomposed into a finite number of congruent parts? Laczkovich (1990) proved this is possible, and moreover the decomposition can be accomplished using translations only (no rotations or reflections needed). Originally posed by Tarski.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 52]
theorem square_circle_decomposition :
    let square := {p : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) |
      |p 0| ≤ 1/2 ∧ |p 1| ≤ 1/2}
    let circle := Metric.closedBall (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)) (1 / Real.sqrt Real.pi)
    ∃ (n : ℕ) (parts_S parts_C : Fin n → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (parts_S i) (parts_S j)) ∧
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (parts_C i) (parts_C j)) ∧
      (⋃ i, parts_S i) = square ∧
      (⋃ i, parts_C i) = circle ∧
      (∀ i, ∃ t : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2),
        parts_C i = (· + t) '' parts_S i) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Correct shapes with equal area (POSITIVE)

The square is defined as `{p | |p 0| ≤ 1/2 ∧ |p 1| ≤ 1/2}`, which is the unit square [-1/2, 1/2]^2 with area 1. The circle is `Metric.closedBall 0 (1 / Real.sqrt Real.pi)`, which has radius r = 1/sqrt(pi), giving area pi * r^2 = pi * (1/pi) = 1. So both shapes have the same area. This is correct.

### 2. Correct decomposition structure (POSITIVE)

The formalization asserts:
- Finitely many parts (`Fin n`)
- Square parts are pairwise disjoint
- Circle parts are pairwise disjoint
- Square parts cover the entire square: `(⋃ i, parts_S i) = square`
- Circle parts cover the entire circle: `(⋃ i, parts_C i) = circle`

This correctly captures the notion of decomposing both shapes into finitely many pieces.

### 3. Translation-only congruence (POSITIVE)

The condition `parts_C i = (· + t) '' parts_S i` says each circle-part is a translation of the corresponding square-part. This matches Laczkovich's result that the decomposition can be done with translations only. This is actually a stronger statement than the original question (which just asks about "congruent parts," allowing rotations and reflections), but since Laczkovich proved the stronger result, this is appropriate.

### 4. No answer elaborator needed (POSITIVE)

Since this is a proved/solved problem with a definite affirmative answer, the formalization correctly states the result directly without `answer(sorry) ↔ ...`. This is the right approach.

### 5. Category tag is correct (POSITIVE)

`@[category research solved, AMS 52]` correctly marks this as a solved problem in convex and discrete geometry.

### 6. n = 0 edge case (MINOR)

When `n = 0`, `Fin 0` is empty, so the union of parts is empty. But the square and circle are non-empty, so `(⋃ i, parts_S i) = square` would be false. This means n = 0 is automatically excluded, which is correct behavior.

### 7. Closed ball vs open ball for the circle (MINOR)

The formalization uses `Metric.closedBall` (closed disk). The source does not specify whether the boundary is included. Since Laczkovich's result works with arbitrary decompositions (the pieces need not be measurable), using the closed disk is a reasonable choice. The square is also defined with `≤` (closed), so this is consistent.

## What a proper formalization would look like

The current formalization is already excellent. It is essentially identical to what a proper formalization should be.

```lean
-- The current formalization is correct as-is.
-- No changes needed.
```

## Confidence: **95%**

This is an excellent formalization. The shapes are correctly defined with equal area, the decomposition conditions (finite, pairwise disjoint, covering) are all present and correct, and the congruence condition (translation only) matches Laczkovich's stronger result. The only conceivable quibble is whether one should use open vs closed sets, but this does not affect mathematical correctness. This is one of the best formalizations in the collection.
