# Review: Erdos Problem 1124

**Problem:** Decomposition of square and circle into congruent parts
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1124](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1124)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Can a square and a circle of the same area be decomposed into a finite number of congruent parts? Laczkovich proved this is possible, and moreover it can be accomplished using translations only. This is related to Tarski's circle-squaring problem.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 52]
theorem square_circle_decomposition :
    ∃ (n : ℕ) (square_parts circle_parts : Fin n → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (square_parts i) (square_parts j)) ∧
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (circle_parts i) (circle_parts j)) ∧
      (∃ isometries : Fin n → (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)),
        ∀ i, True) := by -- Placeholder for isometry condition
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Isometry condition is vacuous (CRITICAL)

The `∀ i, True` placeholder means the isometries have no actual constraint. The statement does not assert that the isometries map square_parts to circle_parts. The core of the problem -- that each piece of the square is congruent to the corresponding piece of the circle -- is absent.

### 2. Missing definitions of the square and circle (CRITICAL)

The problem is about a *specific* square and a *specific* circle of equal area. The formalization never defines what square or circle is being decomposed. There is no reference to any particular geometric shapes -- just abstract families of sets.

### 3. Missing union-equals-shape conditions (CRITICAL)

A proper decomposition requires:
- The union of square_parts equals the square
- The union of circle_parts equals the circle

Neither condition appears. Without these, the "parts" need not cover or relate to any particular shapes.

### 4. Missing equal area constraint (MODERATE)

The source specifies the square and circle have the same area. This constraint is absent.

### 5. Trivially true as written (CRITICAL)

The statement reduces to: "there exist n, two families of pairwise disjoint sets, and some functions, and True." This is trivially true for n = 0 (empty families) or any n with empty sets.

### 6. Isometries not constrained to be actual isometries

The type `EuclideanSpace R (Fin 2) -> EuclideanSpace R (Fin 2)` is just an arbitrary function. There is no `Isometry` constraint.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 52]
theorem square_circle_decomposition :
    let square := {p : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) |
      |p 0| ≤ 1/2 ∧ |p 1| ≤ 1/2}  -- unit square centered at origin
    let circle := Metric.closedBall (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)) (1 / Real.sqrt Real.pi)
    -- same area: side^2 = pi * r^2
    ∃ (n : ℕ) (parts_S parts_C : Fin n → Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (parts_S i) (parts_S j)) ∧
      (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (parts_C i) (parts_C j)) ∧
      (⋃ i, parts_S i) = square ∧
      (⋃ i, parts_C i) = circle ∧
      (∀ i, ∃ t : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2),
        parts_C i = (· + t) '' parts_S i) := by  -- translations only
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **3%**

The formalization gets the high-level structure of "finitely many disjoint parts with isometries between them" partially right, but every substantive mathematical condition is missing: the shapes being decomposed, the coverage conditions, and the actual congruence/isometry requirement. The statement is trivially true.
