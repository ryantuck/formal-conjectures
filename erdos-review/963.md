# Erdős Problem 963 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(n)$ be the maximal $k$ such that in any set $A\subset \mathbb{R}$ of size $n$ there is a subset $B\subseteq A$ of size $\geq k$ which is dissociated. Estimate $f(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/963.lean`.

The function `f(n)` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem `dissociated_subset_size` depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
