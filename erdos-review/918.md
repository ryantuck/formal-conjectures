# Erdős Problem 918 Review

## Problem Statement

Is there a graph with $\aleph_2$ vertices and chromatic number $\aleph_2$ such that every subgraph on $\aleph_1$ vertices has chromatic number $\leq\aleph_0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/918.lean`.

The formalization uses `Cardinal` types correctly to represent the infinite cardinalities.
It correctly translates the vertex count, chromatic number, and the subgraph condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
