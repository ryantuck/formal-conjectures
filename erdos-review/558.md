# Review of Erdos Problem 558

## Problem Statement
Let $R_k(G)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $k$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. Determine $R_k(K_{s,t})$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `ramsey_k22_asymptotic` and `ramsey_k33_asymptotic` but concludes with `sorry`.

```lean
theorem ramsey_k22_asymptotic :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ sorry := by
  sorry

theorem ramsey_k33_asymptotic :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R_k(K_{s,t})$ is not defined.
- The "Determine" part is not captured.
- The theorems seem to address specific cases ($K_{2,2}$ and $K_{3,3}$) which might be known results mentioned in the problem description, but the general problem is to determine $R_k(K_{s,t})$.
