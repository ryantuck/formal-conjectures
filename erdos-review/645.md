# Review of Erdos Problem 645

## Problem Statement
$\mathbb{N}$ 2-colored $\implies$ mono 3-AP $x, x+d, x+2d$ with $d>x$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts existence.

```lean
theorem erdos_645 (c : ℕ → Bool) : ∃ x d, 0 < x ∧ x < d ∧
    (∃ C, c x = C ∧ c (x + d) = C ∧ c (x + 2 * d) = C)
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- $d > x$ captured by `x < d`.
- Mono 3-AP captured correctly.

## Confidence
100%
