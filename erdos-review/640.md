# Review of Erdos Problem 640

## Problem Statement
Does $\chi(G) \ge f(k)$ imply the odd cycle spanning chromatic number is $\ge k$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asks for the existence of such a function $f$.

```lean
noncomputable def oddCycleSpanningChromaticNumber ...
theorem chromatic_implies_odd_cycle_spanning ...
```

## Critique
The formalization matches the problem statement.
- `oddCycleSpanningChromaticNumber` stubbed.
- Implication structure is correct.

## Confidence
100%
