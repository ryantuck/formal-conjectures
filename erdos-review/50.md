# Erdős Problem 50 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that there are no $x$ such that the density of $\{n : \phi(n) < cn\}$ has positive derivative?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/50.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_50` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the non-existence of such $x$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
