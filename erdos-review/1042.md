# Erdős Problem 1042 Review

## Problem Statement

If $f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\in\mathbb{C}[x]$ with all $z_i\in F$ (transfinite diameter 1), can $\{ z: \lvert f(z)vert < 1\}$ have $n$ connected components?
If the transfinite diameter is $<1$, estimate the number of components.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1042.lean`.

The function `componentCount` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
