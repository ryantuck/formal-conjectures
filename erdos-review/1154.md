# Review: Erdos Problem 1154

**Problem:** Hausdorff dimension of rings and fields in ℝ
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1154](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1154)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Does there exist, for every α ∈ [0,1], a ring or field in ℝ with Hausdorff dimension α?

Known results:
- Erdos-Volkmann (1966): For any α ∈ [0,1], a **group** of reals with Hausdorff dimension α exists.
- Mauldin (2016): Subfields of ℝ with any Hausdorff dimension α ∈ [0,1] exist, assuming CH.
- Falconer (1984): Any subring with dim ∈ (1/2, 1) cannot be Borel or Suslin.
- Edgar-Miller (2003): Any Borel/analytic subring of ℝ has Hausdorff dimension 0 or equals ℝ.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem hausdorff_dimension_rings_fields :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ α : ℝ, α ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 →
      (∃ (R : Set ℝ), (∃ (_ : Ring R), True) ∧ dimH R = ENNReal.ofReal α) ∨
      (∃ (F : Set ℝ), (∃ (_ : Field F), True) ∧ dimH F = ENNReal.ofReal α) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Ring/Field structure not constrained to inherit from ℝ (MAJOR)

`∃ (_ : Ring R), True` asserts the existence of **some** ring structure on the subtype `↥R`. This does NOT require the ring operations to be the usual addition and multiplication of ℝ. Any set of the right cardinality could be given an arbitrary ring structure via a bijection with some known ring.

The problem asks about **subrings** and **subfields** of ℝ — sets that are closed under the usual real number operations. The proper formalization should use `Subring ℝ` or `Subfield ℝ`:

```lean
(∃ (R : Subring ℝ), dimH (R : Set ℝ) = ENNReal.ofReal α) ∨
(∃ (F : Subfield ℝ), dimH (F : Set ℝ) = ENNReal.ofReal α)
```

### 2. The disjunction structure is correct

The source says "a ring or field", and the formalization uses `∨` between ring and field existence. This correctly captures that either a ring OR a field suffices.

### 3. dimH usage is correct

`dimH R = ENNReal.ofReal α` correctly states that the Hausdorff dimension of the set R equals α. The `dimH` function from Mathlib returns `ℝ≥0∞`, so the conversion is appropriate.

### 4. Vacuous `True` in existential (MINOR)

The `(∃ (_ : Ring R), True)` pattern is a workaround for expressing "R has a ring structure" in Lean. While functional, using `Subring ℝ` would be cleaner and mathematically more accurate.

### 5. The question format is appropriate

Using `answer(sorry) ↔` for this open question is correct.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem hausdorff_dimension_rings_fields :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ α : ℝ, α ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1 →
      (∃ (R : Subring ℝ), dimH (R : Set ℝ) = ENNReal.ofReal α) ∨
      (∃ (F : Subfield ℝ), dimH (F : Set ℝ) = ENNReal.ofReal α) := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **20%**

The high-level structure (∀ α ∈ [0,1], ∃ ring or field with dim α) is right, and dimH is properly used. But the failure to constrain the ring/field operations to be inherited from ℝ is a major gap — arbitrary ring structures on subsets of ℝ are not what the problem asks about.
