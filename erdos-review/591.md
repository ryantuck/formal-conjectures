# Review of Erdos Problem 591

## Problem Statement
Let $\alpha = \omega^{\omega^2}$. Is it true that any red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_\alpha$ there is either a red $K_\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization asserts the positive answer.

```lean
theorem erdos_591 : answer(True) ↔ OrdinalCardinalRamsey (ω ^ ω ^ 2) (ω ^ ω ^ 2) 3 := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is correct.
- `OrdinalCardinalRamsey` used appropriately.

## Confidence
100%
