# Review of Erdos Problem 553

## Problem Statement
Let $R(3,3,n)$ denote the smallest integer $m$ such that if we 3-colour the edges of $K_m$ then there is either a monochromatic triangle in one of the first two colours or a monochromatic $K_n$ in the third colour. Define $R(3,n)$ similarly but with two colours. Show that
$$\frac{R(3,3,n)}{R(3,n)}\to \infty$$
as $n\to \infty$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `three_color_ramsey_diverges` as `True`.

```lean
theorem three_color_ramsey_diverges :
    True := by
  trivial
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey numbers $R(3,3,n)$ and $R(3,n)$ are not defined.
- The limit behavior is not expressed.
