# Review of Erdos Problem 578

## Problem Statement
If $G$ is a random graph on $2^d$ vertices where each edge is included with probability $1/2$, then $G$ almost surely contains a copy of $Q_d$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization uses measure theory and probability.

```lean
theorem random_graph_contains_hypercube (d : ℕ) ...
    (h_random : ∀ (i j : Fin (2^d)), i ≠ j → ℙ {ω | (G ω).Adj i j} = 1/2)
    ...
    ∀ᵐ ω ∂ℙ, ∃ (f : Fin (2^d) ↪ Fin (2^d)),
      ∀ i j, (hypercubeGraph d).Adj i j ↔ (G ω).Adj (f i) (f j) ...
```

## Critique
The formalization seems correct.
- Random graph definition is standard (probability 1/2).
- "Almost surely" is captured by `∀ᵐ ω ∂ℙ` (for almost all $\omega$).
- Containment of $Q_d$ is expressed as an embedding `f`. Note: the embedding requires `↔` which means induced subgraph isomorphism. The problem usually asks for *a copy* (subgraph), not necessarily *induced*.
- Problem: "...contains a copy of $Q_d$". Usually means subgraph.
- Formalization: `(hypercubeGraph d).Adj i j ↔ (G ω).Adj (f i) (f j)` implies induced.
- If the problem implies subgraph (which is standard for "contains a copy"), the formalization is too strong.
- If it meant induced, it would usually say "induced copy".
- $Q_d$ is a sparse graph. In $G(n, 1/2)$, induced copies of specific sparse graphs are rare? No, $G(n, 1/2)$ is random.
- Actually, for subgraph containment, we only need `→`.
- Verdict: The formalization likely asks for *induced* copy, while the problem likely asks for *subgraph* copy.

## Confidence
80% (Potential subgraph vs induced mismatch)
