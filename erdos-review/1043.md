# Erdős Problem 1043 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a monic non-constant polynomial. Must there exist a straight line $\ell$ such that the projection of $\{ z: \lvert f(z)vert\leq 1\}$ onto $\ell$ has measure at most $2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1043.lean`.

The formalization `erdos_1043` asks if there exists a unit vector $u$ (defining the line) such that the volume (Lebesgue measure) of the orthogonal projection of the level set onto the line spanned by $u$ is $\le 2$.
This matches the problem statement exactly.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.
