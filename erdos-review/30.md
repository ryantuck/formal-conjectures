# Erdős Problem 30 Review

## Problem Statement

Is it true that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, $h(N) = \sqrt N + O(N^\varepsilon)$, where $h(N)$ is max Sidon set size?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/30.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_30` formalizes the asymptotic behavior of $h(N)$.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
