# Erdős Problem 1011 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f_r(n)$ be minimal such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\geq f_r(n)$ edges and chromatic number $\geq r$ contains a triangle. Determine $f_r(n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1011.lean`.

The function `f` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem attempts to express the form of $f_r(n)$ but is also incomplete.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
