# Review: Erdos Problem 1119

**Problem:** Cardinality of families of entire functions with bounded evaluation cardinality
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1119](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1119)
**Status:** OPEN (independent of ZFC in some cases)

## Source Problem

Let m be an infinite cardinal with aleph_0 < m < c = 2^{aleph_0}. Let {f_alpha} be a family of entire functions such that for every z_0 in C, there are at most m distinct values of f_alpha(z_0). Must {f_alpha} have cardinality at most m?

Key results:
- If only countably many distinct values for each z_0, and if c > aleph_1, then the family is countable (Erdos 1964). Fails when c = aleph_1.
- Affirmative when m^+ < c (Hales 1974)
- The answer can be "yes" or "no" depending on the model of set theory when m^+ = c

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem cardinality_entire_function_families :
    ∀ (property : (ℂ → ℂ) → Prop), ∃ (n : ℕ),
      ∀ (S : Finset (ℂ → ℂ)), (∀ f ∈ S, property f) →
        S.card ≤ n := by

```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Uses finite cardinalities instead of infinite cardinals (CRITICAL)

The source problem is fundamentally about infinite cardinal arithmetic (aleph_0, m, c = 2^{aleph_0}). The formalization uses natural numbers (n : N) and Finset, which only handle finite collections. The entire problem is about uncountable families, so restricting to finite sets misses the point entirely.

### 2. Universal quantification over arbitrary properties (CRITICAL)

The formalization says: for ANY property of functions, there exists n such that any finite set of functions satisfying that property has size at most n. This is trivially false: take "property" to be the always-true predicate. Then S can be any finite set of functions, and there is no uniform bound n. (Actually, C -> C is uncountable, so Finset (C -> C) can be arbitrarily large.)

### 3. Missing the key hypothesis about evaluation cardinality (CRITICAL)

The source problem's hypothesis is: for every z_0 in C, the set {f_alpha(z_0) : alpha in family} has cardinality at most m. This "bounded evaluation cardinality" condition is the essential hypothesis and is completely absent.

### 4. Missing entireness condition (CRITICAL)

The source requires each f_alpha to be an entire function. The formalization uses an arbitrary predicate "property" with no connection to analyticity.

### 5. Missing the cardinal m (CRITICAL)

The problem is parameterized by an infinite cardinal m strictly between aleph_0 and c. The formalization has no cardinal parameter.

### 6. Conclusion should be about cardinal of the family, not a finite bound (CRITICAL)

The source asks whether the family has cardinality at most m (an infinite cardinal bound). The formalization asks for a finite upper bound n on the size of finite subsets.

### 7. Problem is independent of ZFC (MODERATE)

The source notes that the answer depends on the model of set theory. A proper formalization might need to state this as a consistency result or work within a specific set-theoretic framework.

### 8. Statement is trivially false (CRITICAL)

As noted, the formalization claims every property of functions admits a uniform finite bound on the size of sets satisfying it, which is false.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- If F is a family of entire functions such that for every z₀ ∈ ℂ,
    the set {f(z₀) : f ∈ F} has cardinality ≤ 𝔪, then |F| ≤ 𝔪.
    This holds when 𝔪⁺ < 𝔠 but is independent of ZFC when 𝔪⁺ = 𝔠. -/
theorem cardinality_entire_function_families
    (𝔪 : Cardinal) (h1 : Cardinal.aleph 0 < 𝔪)
    (h2 : 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum)
    (h3 : Order.succ 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum) :
    ∀ (F : Set (ℂ → ℂ)),
      (∀ f ∈ F, Differentiable ℂ f) →
      (∀ z₀ : ℂ, Cardinal.mk {c : ℂ | ∃ f ∈ F, f z₀ = c} ≤ 𝔪) →
      Cardinal.mk F ≤ 𝔪 := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **1%**

The formalization bears no resemblance to the source problem. It operates in the wrong cardinality regime (finite vs. infinite), has a trivially false universal statement, is missing the core hypothesis about bounded evaluation cardinality, and has no connection to entire functions or cardinal arithmetic.
