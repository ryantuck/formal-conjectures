# Review: Erdos Problem 1119

**Problem:** Cardinality of families of entire functions with bounded evaluation cardinality
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1119](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1119)
**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED (true when m^+ < c; independent of ZFC when m^+ = c)

## Source Problem

Let m be an infinite cardinal with aleph_0 < m < c = 2^{aleph_0}. Let {f_alpha} be a family of entire functions such that for every z_0 in C, there are at most m distinct values of f_alpha(z_0). Must {f_alpha} have cardinality at most m?

Key results:
- Affirmative when m^+ < c (the successor of m is strictly less than the continuum)
- Independent of ZFC when m^+ = c: Kumar-Shelah (2017) showed yes in one model; Schilhan-Weinert (2024) showed no in another

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem cardinality_entire_function_families
    (𝔪 : Cardinal) (h1 : Cardinal.aleph 0 < 𝔪)
    (h2 : 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum)
    (h3 : Order.succ 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum) :
    ∀ (F : Set (ℂ → ℂ)),
      (∀ f ∈ F, Differentiable ℂ f) →
      (∀ z₀ : ℂ, Cardinal.mk {c : ℂ | ∃ f ∈ F, f z₀ = c} ≤ 𝔪) →
      Cardinal.mk F ≤ 𝔪 := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Excellent structural match (POSITIVE)

The rewrite is a complete transformation from the previous version (which used finite cardinalities and was trivially false). The new version correctly:
- Parameterizes by an infinite cardinal m
- Requires aleph_0 < m < c
- Adds the crucial condition m^+ < c (restricting to the provable case)
- Requires all functions in F to be entire
- States the bounded evaluation cardinality condition
- Concludes |F| <= m

### 2. Cardinal conditions are correct (POSITIVE)

- `h1 : Cardinal.aleph 0 < 𝔪` -- m is uncountable
- `h2 : 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum` -- m is less than the continuum
- `h3 : Order.succ 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum` -- m^+ < c (the successor cardinal is strictly less than c)

These three conditions together correctly identify the case where the result is provable in ZFC.

### 3. Evaluation cardinality condition (POSITIVE)

`∀ z₀ : ℂ, Cardinal.mk {c : ℂ | ∃ f ∈ F, f z₀ = c} ≤ 𝔪` correctly states: for every z_0, the set of values {f(z_0) : f in F} has cardinality at most m. The set comprehension `{c : ℂ | ∃ f ∈ F, f z₀ = c}` correctly defines the image of F at z_0.

### 4. Entireness condition (POSITIVE)

`∀ f ∈ F, Differentiable ℂ f` correctly requires each function in the family to be entire.

### 5. Conclusion (POSITIVE)

`Cardinal.mk F ≤ 𝔪` correctly states that the family has cardinality at most m.

### 6. Restricting to the provable case is appropriate (POSITIVE)

The formalization wisely restricts to the case m^+ < c, where the result is provable in ZFC. The case m^+ = c is independent of ZFC and cannot be formalized as a theorem. This is the correct approach.

### 7. The status label says SOLVED (MINOR)

The file header says "SOLVED" and the theorem does not use `answer(sorry)`. Since the result is proved (under the m^+ < c condition), this is correct. The general problem is partially resolved / independent, but the specific provable case is indeed a theorem. This is an appropriate choice.

### 8. F as a Set vs indexed family (MINOR)

The source uses an indexed family {f_alpha}, while the formalization uses a set F of functions. These are equivalent: an indexed family is essentially a function from an index set to functions, and the cardinality of the image equals the cardinality of the family (up to identifying functions with the same behavior). Using `Set (ℂ → ℂ)` is clean and avoids introducing an explicit index type.

### 9. Cardinal.mk on a Set (MINOR)

`Cardinal.mk F` where `F : Set (ℂ → ℂ)` computes the cardinality of F as a type (viewing the set as a subtype). This is correct and standard in Mathlib's cardinal arithmetic.

## What a proper formalization would look like

The current formalization is essentially correct:

```lean
theorem cardinality_entire_function_families
    (𝔪 : Cardinal) (h1 : Cardinal.aleph 0 < 𝔪)
    (h2 : 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum)
    (h3 : Order.succ 𝔪 < Cardinal.continuum) :
    ∀ (F : Set (ℂ → ℂ)),
      (∀ f ∈ F, Differentiable ℂ f) →
      (∀ z₀ : ℂ, Cardinal.mk {c : ℂ | ∃ f ∈ F, f z₀ = c} ≤ 𝔪) →
      Cardinal.mk F ≤ 𝔪 := by
  sorry
```

No changes needed. This is a faithful formalization.

## Confidence: **90%**

The formalization is an excellent match for the source problem. It correctly identifies the provable case (m^+ < c), uses the right cardinal arithmetic, accurately states the bounded evaluation cardinality hypothesis, requires entireness of all functions, and draws the correct conclusion about the cardinality of the family. The only minor concerns are standard Lean/Mathlib technicalities (Cardinal.mk on sets, the choice of Set vs indexed family) that do not affect correctness. This is among the best formalizations in this batch.
