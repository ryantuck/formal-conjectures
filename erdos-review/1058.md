# Erdős Problem 1058 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $2=p_1<p_2<\cdots$ be the sequence of prime numbers. Are there only finitely many $n$ such that $n\in [p_{k-1},p_k)$ and the only primes dividing $n!+1$ are $p_{k}$ and $p_{k+1}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1058.lean`.

The formalization `factorial_plus_one_primes` asserts that there are infinitely many primes of the form $n!+1$.
This is a completely different question from the one asked. The problem asks about the prime factors of $n!+1$ in relation to the prime gap interval containing $n$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
