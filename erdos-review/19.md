# Erdős Problem 19 Review

## Problem Statement

The Erdős-Faber-Lovász conjecture: If $G$ is the union of $n$ copies of $K_n$ which are edge-disjoint, then $\chi(G) = n$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/19.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_19` formalizes the decomposition into cliques and the chromatic number assertion.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
