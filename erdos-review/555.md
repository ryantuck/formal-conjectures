# Review of Erdos Problem 555

## Problem Statement
Let $R_k(G)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $k$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. Determine the value of $R_k(C_{2n})$.

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub.
It defines `even_cycle_ramsey_bounds` with existential quantifiers but concludes with `sorry`.

```lean
theorem even_cycle_ramsey_bounds (n k : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) (hk : k ≥ 2) :
    ∃ c C : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ C > 0 ∧ sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is missing entirely.
- The Ramsey number $R_k(C_{2n})$ is not defined.
- The "Determine the value" part is not captured (which is typical for "determine" problems, usually one would state the conjectured bounds or value if known, but here even the structure is missing).
