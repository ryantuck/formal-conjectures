# Review of Erdos Problem 614

## Problem Statement
Determine $f(n,k)$ (min edges so every induced subgraph on $k+2$ vertices has max degree $\ge k$).

## Lean Formalization
The formalization is a placeholder.

```lean
noncomputable def f (n k : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem determine_f (n k : ℕ) : ∃ m, f n k = m
```

## Critique
The definition of `f` is stubbed, and the theorem just says "it has a value". The actual condition "every induced subgraph..." is not in the Lean code (it's in the comment).

## Confidence
50% (Stub definition)
