# Erdős Problem 978 Review

## Problem Statement

Does the set of integers $n\geq 1$ for which $f(n)$ is $(k-1)$-power-free have positive density? In particular, does $n^4+2$ represent infinitely many squarefree numbers?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/978.lean`.

The theorems `erdos_978.sub_two'` and `erdos_978.squarefree` correctly address the questions about $(k-2)$-power-free values and $n^4+2$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
