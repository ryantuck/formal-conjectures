# Erdős Problem 1027 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $c>0$. Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of at most $c2^n$ many finite sets of size $n$. Let $X=\cup_{A\in \mathcal{F}}A$. Must there exist $\gg_c 2^{\lvert Xvert}$ many sets $B\subset X$ which intersect every set in $\mathcal{F}$, yet contain none of them?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1027.lean`.

The formalization is a placeholder (`sorry`) inside the theorem. It does not define the property of set $B$.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
