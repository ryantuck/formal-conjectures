# Review of Erdos Problem 551

## Problem Statement
Prove that $R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1$ for $k\geq n\geq 3$ (except when $n=k=3$).

## Lean Formalization
The current Lean formalization is a stub. It sets up a theorem `ramsey_cycle_complete` using `Filter.atTop` but the conclusion is `sorry`.

```lean
theorem ramsey_cycle_complete :
    ∀ᶠ (k : ℕ) in Filter.atTop, ∀ (n : ℕ), 3 ≤ n → n ≤ k → ¬(k = 3 ∧ n = 3) →
      sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization is incomplete.
- The conclusion is missing (it's just `sorry`).
- The use of `∀ᶠ (k : ℕ) in Filter.atTop` suggests the property holds for "sufficiently large k", whereas the problem statement asks for it to hold for all $k \ge n \ge 3$ (with the exception). The problem description mentions "verified for sufficiently large k in terms of n", which might be why `Filter.atTop` was chosen, but the conjecture asks for the stronger statement.
- The equality $R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1$ is not expressed.
