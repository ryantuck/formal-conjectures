# Erdős Problem 1023 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $F(n)$ be the maximal size of a family of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no set in this family is the union of other members of the family. Is it true that $F(n)\sim c \frac{2^n}{n^{1/2}}$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1023.lean`.

The function `F` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
