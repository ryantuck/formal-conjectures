# Erdős Problem 961 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(k)$ be the minimal $n$ such that every set of $n$ consecutive integers $>k$ contains an integer divisible by a prime $>k$. Estimate $f(k)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/961.lean`.

The definition of `f(k)` and the conjecture `erdos_961` (asking about log bounds) correctly capture the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
