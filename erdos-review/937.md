# Erdős Problem 937 Review

## Problem Statement

Are there infinitely many four-term arithmetic progressions of coprime powerful numbers?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/937.lean`.

The theorem `coprime_powerful_ap` asserts the existence of *one* AP of length $k$ for every $k$.
It does not assert that there are *infinitely many* such APs of length 4.
The problem specifically asks for infinitude for the case $k=4$. The formalization proves existence for arbitrary $k$, but existence of one $k$-term AP does not imply existence of infinitely many 4-term APs (though proving it for *arbitrary* $k$ likely involves a construction that gives infinitely many).
However, technically, `∃ (a d)` is just one.

## Completeness

The formalization is weak/incorrect (missing infinitude).
