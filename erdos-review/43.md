# Erdős Problem 43 Review

## Problem Statement

If $A, B$ are Sidon sets with disjoint difference sets, is $\binom{|A|}{2} + \binom{|B|}{2} \le \binom{f(N)}{2} + O(1)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/43.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_43` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this inequality. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
