# Erdős Problem 959 Review

## Problem Statement

Estimate $\max (f(d_1)-f(d_2))$, where $f(d_i)$ are sorted distance frequencies.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/959.lean`.

The theorem `distance_frequency_gap` asks for a function $g(n)$ that bounds the difference $f(d_1) - f(d_2)$ (assuming sorted descending) from below?
`g n ≤ ...`.
This effectively defines $g(n)$ as a lower bound on the maximum difference.
This is a reasonable formalization of "Estimate".

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
