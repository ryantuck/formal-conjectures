# Erdős Problem 1055 Review

## Problem Statement

A prime $p$ is in class $1$ if the only prime divisors of $p+1$ are $2$ or $3$. In general, a prime $p$ is in class $r$ if every prime factor of $p+1$ is in some class $\leq r-1$. Are there infinitely many primes in each class? If $p_r$ is the least prime in class $r$, then how does $p_r^{1/r}$ behave?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1055.lean`.

The recursive definition `IsOfClass` captures the problem statement.
The theorems correctly ask for the infinitude of primes in each class and the behavior of $p_r^{1/r}$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
