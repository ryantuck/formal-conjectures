# Erdős Problem 1081 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $A(x)$ count the number of $n\leq x$ which are the sum of two squarefull numbers (a number $m$ is squarefull if $p\mid m$ implies $p^2\mid m$). Is it true that $A(x) \sim c \frac{x}{\sqrt{\log x}}$ for some $c>0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1081.lean`.

The predicate `isSquarefull` is correctly defined.
However, the conjecture `squarefull_sums` is formalized as:
`∀ n : ℕ, ∃ a b : ℕ, isSquarefull a ∧ isSquarefull b ∧ a + b = n`
This statement asserts that *every* natural number $n$ is the sum of two squarefull numbers. The problem statement asks about the asymptotic count $A(x)$ of such numbers. The formalization is a much stronger (and likely false) statement that does not correspond to the problem.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect. It formalizes a different question.
