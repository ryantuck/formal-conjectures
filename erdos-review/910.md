# Erdős Problem 910 Review

## Problem Statement

Does every connected set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contain a connected subset which is not a point and not homeomorphic to the original set?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/910.lean`.

The theorem `not_connected_subsets` asserts `¬ ∀ ... ∃ T ...`.
The condition for $T$ is `T ⊂ S ∧ T.Nonempty ∧ IsConnected T`.
The problem requires the subset to be "not a point".
The formalization allows $T$ to be a single point (which is nonempty and connected).
Since almost every connected set contains a proper subset that is a point, the inner statement `∃ T ...` is true (making the negated theorem false).
The formalization fails to capture the "non-trivial" condition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
