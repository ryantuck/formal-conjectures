# Erdős Problem 922 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $k\geq 0$. Let $G$ be a graph such that every subgraph $H$ contains an independent set of size $\geq (n-k)/2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $H$. Must $G$ have chromatic number at most $k+2$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/922.lean`.

The formalization `independent_chromatic` assumes `G` has an independent set of size $> |G|/2$ and concludes $\chi(G) \le 3$.
This corresponds to $k=0$ (roughly), and only checks the condition for $G$ itself, not "every subgraph".
The general parameter $k$ is missing.

## Completeness

The formalization is incorrect.
