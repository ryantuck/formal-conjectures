# Review of Erdos Problem 569

## Problem Statement
Determine the best possible constant $c_k$ such that $R(C_{2k+1}, H) \le c_k m$ for any graph $H$ on $m$ edges without isolated vertices.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization seeks a constant $c$ that is the supremum of the ratio.

```lean
def ramseyNumber (G : SimpleGraph α) (H : SimpleGraph β) : ℕ := sorry

theorem ramsey_odd_cycle_constant (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 1) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, ...
```

## Critique
Similar to Problem 568, the use of `ramseyNumber` is ambiguous.
- The context implies **size Ramsey number** (linear bound in edges $m$).
- The local definition `ramseyNumber` is a stub.
- The logic for "best possible constant" is correctly formalized using the definition of supremum (upper bound and least upper bound property).

## Confidence
90% (deducted for naming ambiguity)
