# Erdős Problem 1090 Review

## Problem Statement
Let $k \geq 3$. Does there exist a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that, in any $2$-colouring of $A$, there exists a line which contains at least $k$ points from $A$, and all the points of $A$ on the line have the same colour?

## Formalization Review
The formalization in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1090.lean` is:
```lean
theorem monochromatic_lines (k : ℕ) (hk : 3 ≤ k) :
    ∃ (A : Finset (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))),
      ∀ (f : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2) → Fin 2),
        ∃ (L : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2))) (c : Fin 2),
          sorry := by
  sorry
```
The statement is incomplete. It sets up the existence of the set $A$ and the coloring $f$, but the core condition—that there exists a line $L$ containing at least $k$ points of $A$ which are all monochromatic—is replaced by `sorry`.

## Completeness
The formalization is incomplete. The logical condition describing the property of the line and the points is missing.
