# Erdős Problem 176 Review

## Problem Statement

Bounds for $N(k, \ell)$, the minimal $N$ to force discrepancy $\ell$ on a $k$-term AP.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/176.lean`.

The theorems `erdos_176_1`, `_2`, `_3` ask if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the existence of such bounds. Wait, the Lean file asks for proofs `by sorry` without the `answer` pattern for the theorems themselves, effectively stating the conjectures as true. But the problem asks "Is it true...". The `answer` pattern is used in other files. Here, the theorems assert the existence of the bound. This is a valid way to formalize a conjecture (as a theorem to be proved).

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proofs, but the statements are complete.

## Confidence

100%
