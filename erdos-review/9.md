# Erdős Problem 9 Review

## Problem Statement

Is the upper density of the set of odd numbers that cannot be expressed as a prime plus two powers of 2 positive?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/9.lean`.

The set `Erdos9A` defines odd numbers not expressible as $p + 2^k + 2^l$. The theorem `erdos_9` asks if the `upperDensity` of this set is greater than 0. This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
