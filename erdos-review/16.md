# Erdős Problem 16 Review

## Problem Statement

Is the set of odd integers not of the form $2^k + p$ the union of an infinite arithmetic progression and a set of density $0$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/16.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_16` asks if `answer(False)` is equivalent to the set $S$ being such a union. This matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
