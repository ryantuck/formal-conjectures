# Review: Erdos Problem 1136

**Problem:** Sumset-free sets avoiding powers of 2 with high lower density
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1136](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1136)
**Status:** PROVED

## Source Problem

Does there exist A subset of N with lower density > 1/3 such that a + b != 2^k for any a, b in A and k >= 0?

Muller proved the answer is yes, constructing a set with density 1/2, and showed this is optimal.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem sumset_free_high_density :
    ∃ (A : Set ℕ),
      (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, ∀ k : ℕ, a + b ≠ 2^k) ∧
      liminf (fun X => (A ∩ Set.Icc 1 X).ncard / X) atTop > 1/3 := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Core mathematical content is correct (MINOR positive)

The formalization asks for the existence of a set A where no two elements sum to a power of 2, and the lower density exceeds 1/3. This exactly matches the source problem.

### 2. Correct status (MINOR positive)

Correctly marked as solved. The problem is proved (answer is yes), and the formalization directly asserts the existence of such a set, which is the correct approach for a solved existence problem.

### 3. Type issue with density computation (MODERATE)

As with Problem 1134, the expression `(A ∩ Set.Icc 1 X).ncard / X` involves `ℕ`-valued division, which truncates. For lower density > 1/3, this needs real-valued division. The `liminf` and the comparison `> 1/3` would need the function to produce real values. Depending on Lean's type inference, this might silently coerce or might produce meaningless results. Properly, one needs `((A ∩ Set.Icc 1 X).ncard : ℝ) / (X : ℝ)`.

### 4. a + b allows a = b (MINOR)

The source says "a + b != 2^k for any a, b in A". The formalization allows a = b (so 2a != 2^k for any a in A). This is consistent with the source -- the problem does not restrict to a != b.

### 5. No use of answer elaborator (MINOR positive)

Since the problem is solved (proved affirmatively), directly stating the existence without `answer(True)` is a valid approach. The formalization simply asserts the true statement.

### 6. k >= 0 vs k : N (MINOR)

The source says k >= 0, and the formalization uses k : N, which starts at 0. Since 2^0 = 1, this correctly includes the case a + b != 1. This is fine.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem sumset_free_high_density :
    ∃ (A : Set ℕ),
      (∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, ∀ k : ℕ, a + b ≠ 2^k) ∧
      liminf (fun X : ℕ => ((A ∩ Set.Icc 1 X).ncard : ℝ) / (X : ℝ)) atTop > 1/3 := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **75%**

The formalization captures the correct mathematical statement with the right quantifier structure. The main concern is the potential type issue with natural number division in the density computation. If Lean's type inference handles the coercion correctly (which it may, given the comparison with 1/3 : ℝ), the statement is essentially correct. The mathematical content is faithfully represented.
