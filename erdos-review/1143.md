# Review: Erdos Problem 1143

**Problem:** Estimation of F_k(p_1,...,p_u) for multiples of primes in intervals
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1143](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1143)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let p_1 < ... < p_u be primes and k >= 1. Define F_k(p_1,...,p_u) such that every interval of k positive integers contains at least F_k(p_1,...,p_u) multiples of at least one of the primes p_i. Estimate F_k(p_1,...,p_u), particularly when k = alpha * p_u for constant alpha > 2.

Known: Erdos and Selfridge determined the exact bound when 2 < alpha < 3. For alpha > 3, very little is known.

## Current Formalization

```lean
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem prime_multiples_in_intervals :
    ∃ (F : ℕ → List ℕ → ℕ), ∀ k : ℕ, ∀ primes : List ℕ,
      (∀ p ∈ primes, Nat.Prime p) →
      answer(sorry) = F k primes := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. No mathematical content (CRITICAL)

The formalization says "there exists a function F such that answer(sorry) equals F applied to any inputs." This has no mathematical content whatsoever. It does not:
- Define what F_k(p_1,...,p_u) means (the minimum count of multiples in intervals)
- State any estimation bounds
- Connect F to the interval-multiples counting problem

### 2. Type mismatch with answer(sorry) (CRITICAL)

The expression `answer(sorry) = F k primes` attempts to equate `answer(sorry)` (which produces a `Bool` or `Prop` value in the answer elaborator framework) with `F k primes : ℕ`. This is a type error — one cannot equate a boolean/propositional answer with a natural number. The `answer(sorry)` pattern is designed for yes/no questions (`answer(sorry) ↔ P`), not for numerical estimation problems.

### 3. Placeholder formalization (CRITICAL)

The docstring itself acknowledges "The function F_k and its properties require precise formulation from the original problem statement." This is a self-described placeholder, not a genuine attempt at formalization.

### 4. The estimation problem is not naturally a yes/no question (MODERATE)

The source asks to "estimate" F_k, which is an open-ended quantitative question rather than a yes/no question. A proper formalization would state specific bounds (upper and/or lower) on F_k, or define F_k and state conjectured asymptotics.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- F_k(p_1,...,p_u) = minimum number of multiples of at least one p_i
    in any interval of k consecutive integers -/
noncomputable def F_k (k : ℕ) (primes : Finset ℕ) : ℕ :=
  ⨅ (a : ℕ), (Finset.Icc a (a + k - 1) ∩
    (primes.biUnion fun p => (Finset.Icc a (a + k - 1)).filter (p ∣ ·))).card

-- Then state bounds, e.g., for the known case 2 < alpha < 3:
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem prime_multiples_estimation (primes : Finset ℕ) (hprimes : ∀ p ∈ primes, Nat.Prime p)
    (alpha : ℝ) (halpha : 2 < alpha ∧ alpha < 3) :
    -- State specific bounds on F_k when k = alpha * max(primes)
    sorry := by
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

This is a non-formalization — a placeholder with no mathematical content. The statement is type-incorrect (equating answer(sorry) with a ℕ value), does not define the extremal function F_k, does not state any bounds, and does not connect to the source problem's interval-multiples counting framework. The file would need to be completely rewritten from scratch.
