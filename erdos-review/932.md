# Erdős Problem 932 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $p_k$ denote the $k$th prime. For infinitely many $r$ there are at least two integers $p_r<n<p_{r+1}$ all of whose prime factors are $<p_{r+1}-p_r$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/932.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_932` defines the set of indices $r$ such that the count of such integers is $\ge 2$.
It correctly uses `m.maxPrimeFac` to check the prime factor condition.
It asserts this set is `Infinite`.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
