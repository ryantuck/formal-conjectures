# Erdős Problem 71 Review

## Problem Statement

If $P$ is an infinite arithmetic progression of even numbers, does every graph with sufficiently large average degree contain a cycle with length in $P$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/71.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_71` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to this property. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete.

## Confidence

100%
