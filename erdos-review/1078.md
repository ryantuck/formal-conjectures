# Erdős Problem 1078 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $G$ be an $r$-partite graph with $n$ vertices in each part. If $G$ has minimum degree $\geq (r-\frac{3}{2}-o(1))n$ then $G$ must contain a $K_r$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1078.lean`.

The formalization is incomplete (`sorry`). It sets up an $r$-partite graph structure but fails to state the minimum degree condition or the existence of a $K_r$ subgraph.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.

## Confidence
