# Review: Erdos Problem 1113

**Problem:** Sierpinski numbers without finite covering sets

## Source Problem

A positive odd integer m is a Sierpinski number if none of 2^k * m + 1 are prime for any k >= 0. A set of primes P constitutes a covering set for m if every number of the form 2^k * m + 1 is divisible by at least one prime in P.

Central question: Do there exist Sierpinski numbers that possess no finite covering set of primes?

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem sierpinski_without_covering :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ k : ℕ, Odd k ∧
      (∀ n : ℕ, ¬ Nat.Prime (k * 2^n + 1)) ∧
      (¬ ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), ∀ p ∈ S, Nat.Prime p ∧
        ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1)) := by
  sorry
```

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Covering set condition has wrong quantifier nesting (MODERATE)

The covering set condition in the formalization says:
```
¬ ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), ∀ p ∈ S, Nat.Prime p ∧ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1)
```

This reads as: there is no finite set S such that for all p in S, (p is prime AND for all n, there exists p' in S dividing k * 2^n + 1). The problem is that the `∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1)` is nested under `∀ p ∈ S`, making the entire covering condition say "every element of S is prime AND for every n there's some element of S dividing k*2^n+1" -- but this second part is the same for every p and does not depend on the outer p.

The correct covering set definition should be:
```
¬ ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), (∀ p ∈ S, Nat.Prime p) ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1))
```

The parenthesization is wrong: the primality condition and the covering condition should be separate conjuncts, not nested under the same universal.

### 2. Quantifier scoping issue in detail (MODERATE)

Looking more carefully: `∀ p ∈ S, Nat.Prime p ∧ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1)` parses as `∀ p ∈ S, (Nat.Prime p ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1)))`. The inner `∃ p ∈ S` introduces a fresh variable that shadows the outer `p`. So the covering part `∀ n, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ ...` is correct in isolation, but it is oddly repeated for each element of S. More problematically, if S is empty, the universal `∀ p ∈ S, ...` is vacuously true, so the negation would say "there is no empty set," which is false. This means the negation `¬ ∃ S, ∀ p ∈ S, ...` would be satisfied by S = {} being a valid covering set, which is wrong since the empty set doesn't cover anything.

Wait -- actually the negation says it's NOT the case that such an S exists. If S = {} makes the inner statement vacuously true, then the existence IS satisfied, and the negation is false. So the formalization would claim no Sierpinski number lacks a covering set (since {} vacuously works), which is wrong.

### 3. The Sierpinski condition is correct (POSITIVE)

The first two conjuncts -- Odd k and (forall n, not prime (k * 2^n + 1)) -- correctly capture that k is a Sierpinski number.

### 4. Variable naming (MINOR)

The variable is called `k` but the source uses `m`. This is cosmetic and does not affect correctness.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
theorem sierpinski_without_covering :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∃ k : ℕ, Odd k ∧ 0 < k ∧
      (∀ n : ℕ, ¬ Nat.Prime (k * 2^n + 1)) ∧
      (¬ ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), (∀ p ∈ S, Nat.Prime p) ∧
        (∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p ∈ S, p ∣ (k * 2^n + 1))) := by
  sorry
```

Key changes: separate the primality condition from the covering condition with a top-level conjunction, and add 0 < k to ensure positivity.

## Confidence: **55%**

The Sierpinski number definition is correct. The covering set definition has a parenthesization issue that, due to vacuous truth with the empty set, actually makes the statement logically incorrect. With the correct parenthesization and a positivity condition, this would be a good formalization.
