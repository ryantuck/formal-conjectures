# Review of Erdos Problem 585

## Problem Statement
What is the maximum number of edges a graph on $n$ vertices can have if it contains no two edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertex set?

## Lean Formalization
The formalization provides bounds for `maxEdges`.

```lean
noncomputable def maxEdges (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem lower_bound : ... ≥ c * n * log (log n)
theorem upper_bound : ... ≤ c * n * (log n)^k
```

## Critique
The definition of `maxEdges` is a stub, so the condition "no two edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertex set" is not formalized in the logic, only implied by the name/comments.
However, the bounds are consistent with the problem description.
Without the definition of the property in `maxEdges`, the problem is not fully captured, but the theorems reflect the known/conjectured bounds.

## Confidence
90% (Assuming definition is filled correctly)
