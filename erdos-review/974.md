# Erdős Problem 974 Review

## Problem Statement

Suppose that the sequence of $s_k=\sum_{1\leq i\leq n}z_i^k$ contains infinitely many $(n-1)$-tuples of consecutive values of $s_k$ which are all $0$. Then $z_j=e(j/n)$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/974.lean`.

The theorem `roots_unity_characterization` correctly translates the condition on consecutive zero sums and the conclusion about roots of unity.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
