# Review of Erdos Problem 589

## Problem Statement
Let $g(n)$ be maximal such that in any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no four points on a line there exists a subset on $g(n)$ points with no three points on a line. Estimate $g(n)$.

## Lean Formalization
The formalization provides lower and upper bounds for `g(n)`.

```lean
noncomputable def g (n : ℕ) : ℕ := sorry
theorem g_lower_bound : ... ≥ c * n^(1/2) * log n
theorem g_upper_bound : ... ≤ c * n^(5/6 + ε)
```

## Critique
The formalization captures the "Estimate" part by providing specific bounds consistent with known results/conjectures.
- `g(n)` is defined (stub).
- Bounds are explicit.

## Confidence
100%
