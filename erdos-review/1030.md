# Erdős Problem 1030 Review

## Problem Statement

If $R(k,l)$ is the Ramsey number then prove the existence of some $c>0$ such that $\lim_k \frac{R(k+1,k)}{R(k,k)}> 1+c$.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/1030.lean`.

The function `R` is a placeholder (`sorry`). The theorem statement depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
