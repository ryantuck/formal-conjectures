# Erdős Problem 114 Review

## Problem Statement

Maximizing lemniscate length for monic polynomials.

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/114.lean`.

The theorem `erdos_114` asks if `answer(sorry)` corresponds to the maximality of $z^n-1$. Matches.

## Completeness

The formalization uses `sorry` for the proof, but the statement is complete (modulo definition of length).

## Confidence

100%
