# Erdős Problem 987 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $x_1,x_2,\ldots \in (0,1)$. Let $A_k=\limsup_{n	o \infty}\left\lvert \sum_{j\leq n} e(kx_j)ightvert$. Is it possible for $A_k=o(k)$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/987.lean`.

The theorem `exponential_sum_growth` correctly defines $A_k$ (as $A'$ in the inner scope) and asks if there exists a sequence `seq'` such that $A_k = o(k)$.

## Completeness

The formalization is complete and accurate.

## Confidence

100%
