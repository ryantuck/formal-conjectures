# Review: Erdos Problem 1112

**Problem:** Lacunary sequences and sumset avoidance
**Source:** [erdosproblems.com/1112](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1112)
**Status:** OPEN

## Source Problem

Let 1 <= d_1 < d_2 and k >= 3. Does there exist an integer r such that if B = {b_1 < b_2 < ...} is a lacunary sequence with b_{i+1} >= r * b_i, then there exists a sequence A = {a_1 < a_2 < ...} satisfying:

1. d_1 <= a_{i+1} - a_i <= d_2 for all i >= 1 (consecutive differences are bounded)
2. (kA) intersect B = empty (the k-fold sumset of A avoids B)

Known: r_2(2,3) = 2 exists, r_3(2,3) does not exist. Chen proved r_2(a,b) <= 2 for a < b with b != 2a.

## Current Formalization

```lean
theorem lacunary_sumset_gaps :
    ∃ (A : Set ℕ),
      (∀ᶠ n in atTop, ∀ a ∈ A, a < n → ∀ a' ∈ A, a' < n → a' ≠ a → (a' : ℝ) / a ≥ 2) ∧
      (∃ gap : ℕ, ∀ n, ∃ k, ∀ m ∈ Set.Icc k (k + gap), m ∉ {a + b | (a ∈ A) (b ∈ A)}) := by

## Critical Analysis

### 1. Roles of A and B are confused (CRITICAL)

The source problem has two sequences: B is the lacunary sequence (given), and A is the sequence with bounded gaps (to be found). The formalization conflates these: it has a single set A that is both lacunary (first conjunct) and has sumset gaps (second conjunct). The source asks for A to avoid the sumset hitting B, not for A's sumset to have gaps.

### 2. Missing the k-fold sumset (CRITICAL)

The source asks about kA (the k-fold sumset, i.e., sums of exactly k elements from A). The formalization only uses the 2-fold sumset {a + b | a in A, b in A}. The parameter k >= 3 is central to the problem since the k = 2 case is already largely resolved.

### 3. Missing the lacunary sequence B (CRITICAL)

The source involves a separate lacunary sequence B with the property b_{i+1} >= r * b_i. The formalization has no such sequence; instead it tries to make A itself lacunary (which contradicts A having bounded gaps).

### 4. Wrong lacunarity condition applied to wrong object (CRITICAL)

The formalization requires A to be lacunary (ratio of consecutive elements >= 2), but A is supposed to have bounded consecutive differences (d_1 <= a_{i+1} - a_i <= d_2). A sequence with bounded differences cannot be lacunary. The lacunarity condition belongs to B, not A.

### 5. Missing bounded gap condition on A (CRITICAL)

The source requires d_1 <= a_{i+1} - a_i <= d_2. The formalization has no such condition. Instead, it has a lacunarity condition on A which is incompatible with bounded gaps.

### 6. Missing quantification over r, d_1, d_2, k (CRITICAL)

The source asks: does there exist r (depending on d_1, d_2, k) such that for ALL lacunary sequences B with ratio >= r, there EXISTS a sequence A with bounded gaps whose k-fold sumset avoids B. The formalization has none of this quantifier structure.

### 7. Sumset gap conclusion is wrong (CRITICAL)

The source asks for kA intersect B = empty. The formalization asks for gaps in the 2-fold sumset of A, which is a completely different property.

## What a proper formalization would look like

```lean
/-- k-fold sumset -/
def kSumset (k : ℕ) (A : Set ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  sorry -- sum of k elements from A

theorem lacunary_sumset_avoidance (d₁ d₂ : ℕ) (hd : 1 ≤ d₁ ∧ d₁ < d₂) (k : ℕ) (hk : 3 ≤ k) :
    answer(sorry) ↔
      ∃ (r : ℕ), ∀ (B : ℕ → ℕ),
        (∀ i, B (i + 1) ≥ r * B i) → -- B is lacunary with ratio r
        ∃ (A : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono A ∧
          (∀ i, d₁ ≤ A (i + 1) - A i ∧ A (i + 1) - A i ≤ d₂) ∧ -- bounded gaps
          Disjoint (kSumset k (Set.range A)) (Set.range B) := by -- kA avoids B
  sorry
```

## Confidence: **2%**

Nearly every component of the formalization is wrong. The roles of A and B are confused, the k-fold sumset is replaced by 2-fold sumset, the lacunarity condition is applied to the wrong object, bounded gaps are missing, and the quantifier structure is completely absent.
