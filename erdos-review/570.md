# Review of Erdos Problem 570

## Problem Statement
Let $k \ge 3$. Is it true that, if $m$ is sufficiently large, for any graph $H$ on $m$ edges without isolated vertices,
$$ R(C_k,H) \leq 2m + \lfloor(k-1)/2\rfloor? $$

## Lean Formalization
The formalization defines `ramseyNumber` (stub) and the theorem `ramsey_cycle_bound`.

```lean
def ramseyNumber (G : SimpleGraph α) (H : SimpleGraph β) : ℕ := sorry

theorem ramsey_cycle_bound (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 3) :
    ∃ M : ℕ, ∀ (H : SimpleGraph β) (m : ℕ),
      H.edgeSet.ncard = m →
      m ≥ M →
      (∀ v, ∃ w, H.Adj v w) →
      ramseyNumber (cycleGraph k) H ≤ 2 * m + (k - 1) / 2 :=
  sorry
```

## Critique
The formalization matches the problem statement well.
- `ramseyNumber` is used appropriately for $R(C_k, H)$. Although defined as a stub, its usage context implies standard Ramsey number. However, given previous problems, there's a risk of ambiguity with *size* Ramsey number if not careful, but the notation $R(C_k,H)$ usually refers to the standard (vertex) Ramsey number where one graph is fixed and the other varies by edges. Wait, standard Ramsey number $R(G,H)$ is usually about coloring $K_N$. Here $H$ is a graph on $m$ edges. This looks like the **Ramsey-Turán** or **Generalized Ramsey** number where we color $K_N$.
- The inequality $2m + \lfloor(k-1)/2\rfloor$ is correctly transcribed.
- "Sufficiently large" is captured by `∃ M, ... m ≥ M`.
