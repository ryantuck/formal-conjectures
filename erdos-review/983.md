# Erdős Problem 983 Review

## Problem Statement

Let $f(k,n)$ be the smallest integer $r$ such that in any $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of size $k$ there exist primes $p_1,\ldots,p_r$ such that $>r$ many $a\in A$ are only divisible by primes from $\{p_1,\ldots,p_r\}$. Is it true that $2\pi(n^{1/2})-f(\pi(n)+1,n)	o \infty$?

## Formalization

The problem is formalized in `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/983.lean`.

The function `f` is a placeholder (`sorry`).
The theorem depends on this missing definition.

## Completeness

The formalization is incomplete.
