# Erdős Problem 839

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/839](https://www.erdosproblems.com/839)

Given a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers where no term equals the sum of
consecutive earlier terms, is it true that $\limsup a_n / n = \infty$? A stronger form asks
whether $(1/\log x) \sum_{a_n < x} 1/a_n \to 0$.

A problem of Erdős [Er78f][Er92c].

/-- A sequence $a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is "sum-of-consecutive-free" if no term equals
the sum of a contiguous block of earlier terms. That is, for all $i$,
$a_i \neq a_j + a_{j+1} + \cdots + a_k$ for any $j \leq k < i$. -/

Erdős Problem 839 (Part 1) [Er78f][Er92c]:

Let $1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers
such that no $a_i$ is the sum of consecutive $a_j$ for $j < i$.
Is it true that $\limsup a_n / n = \infty$?

Erdős Problem 839 (Part 2, stronger) [Er78f][Er92c]:

Let $1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \cdots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers
such that no $a_i$ is the sum of consecutive $a_j$ for $j < i$.
Is it true that $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{\log x} \sum_{a_n < x} \frac{1}{a_n} = 0$?
