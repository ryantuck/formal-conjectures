# Erdős Problem 1133

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1133](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1133)

[Er67] Erdős, P., _Problems and results on the convergence and divergence properties of the
Lagrange interpolation polynomials and some extremal problems_. Mathematica (Cluj) (1967), 65–73.

Erdős proved that, for any $C > 0$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently
large and $m = \lfloor(1+\varepsilon)n\rfloor$ then for any $x_1, \ldots, x_m \in [-1,1]$ there is
a polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ such that $|P(x_i)| \le 1$ for $1 \le i \le m$ and
$\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x)| > C$.
The conjectured statement would also imply this, but Erdős said he could not even prove
it for $m = n$.

Erdős Problem 1133:
Let $C > 0$. There exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, for any
$x_1, \ldots, x_n \in [-1,1]$ there exist $y_1, \ldots, y_n \in [-1,1]$ such that any polynomial
$P$ of degree $< (1+\varepsilon)n$ that agrees with $y_i$ at $x_i$ for at least $(1-\varepsilon)n$
indices $i$ must satisfy $\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x)| > C$.
