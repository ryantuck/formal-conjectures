# Erdős Problem 77

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/77](https://www.erdosproblems.com/77)

If $R(k)$ is the diagonal Ramsey number, the minimal $n$ such that every 2-colouring
of the edges of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$, then find the value of
$$\lim_{k \to \infty} R(k)^{1/k}.$$

Erdős proved $\sqrt{2} \leq \liminf R(k)^{1/k} \leq \limsup R(k)^{1/k} \leq 4$.
The upper bound has been improved to $3.7992\ldots$ by Gupta, Ndiaye, Norin, and
Wei [GNNW24], building on the breakthrough of Campos, Griffiths, Morris,
and Sahasrabudhe [CGMS23] who first improved the upper bound below 4.
A simplified proof of the sub-4 bound was given by Balister, Bollobás, Campos,
Griffiths, Hurley, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [BBCGHMST24].

Erdős conjectured the limit is "perhaps 2 but we have no real evidence for this" [Er93].

Erdős offered \$100 for proving the limit exists, and \$1,000 (later raised to \$10,000
in [Er88]) for proving it does not exist.
