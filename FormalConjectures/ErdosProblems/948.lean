# Erdős Problem 948

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/948](https://www.erdosproblems.com/948)

[Er77c] Erdős, P., _Problems and results on combinatorial number theory. III._. Number Theory Day
(Proc. Conf., Rockefeller Univ., New York, 1976) (1977), 43–72.

Erdős initially asked whether this is possible with the set being monochromatic,
but Galvin showed that this is not always possible. This is a variant of
Hindman's theorem (see [532]).

/-- Is there a function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for any
$k$-colouring $\chi$ of the natural numbers, there is a strictly increasing sequence $a$ with
$a(n) < f(n)$ for infinitely many $n$, and the finite subset sums of the sequence do not achieve
all $k$ colours? -/
