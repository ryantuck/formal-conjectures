# Erdős Problem 7

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/7](https://www.erdosproblems.com/7)

Erdős and Selfridge asked whether there exists a distinct covering system all of whose
moduli are odd.

systems_. Ann. of Math. (2019).

[BBMST22] Balister, P., Bollobás, B., Morris, R., Sahasrabudhe, J. and Tiba, M., _Covering
systems, matchings, and odd covering systems_. (2022).

Selfridge showed that this problem would have a positive answer if a covering system with
pairwise non-divisible moduli existed (see Problem 586).

Is there a distinct covering system all of whose moduli are odd?

A **distinct covering system** (`StrictCoveringSystem`) is a finite collection of
congruences $\{n \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}\}$ where all moduli $m_i$ are pairwise distinct,
covering every integer. The question asks whether such a system can exist with all
moduli odd and at least 2.

Known results:
- [HoNi19] proved that in any distinct covering system, at least one modulus must be
  divisible by 2 or 3. A simpler proof was given by [BBMST22], who also showed that the
  lcm of any odd covering system's moduli must be divisible by 9 or 15.
- [BBMST22] proved no odd distinct covering system exists if the moduli are additionally
  required to be squarefree. The general odd case remains open.

There is no distinct covering system with all moduli odd and squarefree.

This is a stronger variant of `erdos_7` where the moduli are additionally required to be
squarefree. It was disproved by [BBMST22] Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba.
