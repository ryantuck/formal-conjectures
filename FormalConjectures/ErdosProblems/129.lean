# Erdős Problem 129

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/129](https://www.erdosproblems.com/129)

Let $R(n; k, r)$ be the smallest $N$ such that if the edges of $K_N$ are $r$-coloured
then there is a set of $n$ vertices which does not contain a copy of $K_k$ in at
least one of the $r$ colours. Erdős and Gyárfás conjectured that there exists a
constant $C = C(r) > 1$ such that $R(n; 3, r) < C^{\sqrt{n}}$.

As pointed out by Antonio Girao, the problem as stated is easily
disproved. A probabilistic argument shows $R(n; 3, 2) \geq C^n$ for some $C > 1$,
contradicting the claimed bound. The correct formulation is unclear.

/-- An $r$-edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_N$: a function that assigns a
color in $\operatorname{Fin} r$ to each ordered pair of vertices.
Note: this allows coloring of self-loops ($\chi\, x\, x$), which is semantically
meaningless for $K_N$ but harmless since `IsMonoKkFree` only examines pairs
with $x \ne y$. -/

/-- A vertex set $S$ is monochromatic-$K_k$-free in color $c$ under coloring $\chi$ if
there is no $k$-element subset of $S$ in which every pair of distinct vertices
receives color $c$. -/

/-- The generalized Ramsey number $R(n; k, r)$: the smallest $N$ such that for
every symmetric $r$-coloring of the edges of $K_N$ (i.e., $\chi\, x\, y = \chi\, y\, x$),
there exists a set of $n$ vertices and a color $c$ such that the set is
$K_k$-free in color $c$. -/

Erdős–Gyárfás Conjecture (Problem 129) [Er97b]:
For every $r \geq 1$, does there exist a constant $C = C(r) > 1$ such that
$R(n; 3, r) < C^{\sqrt{n}}$ for all positive integers $n$?

The conjecture is **disproved** (`answer(False)`): as observed by Antonio Girao,
a probabilistic coloring of $K_N$ (each edge independently uniformly at random
in $r$ colors) shows $R(n; 3, 2) \geq C^n$ for some $C > 1$, which grows faster
than $C^{\sqrt{n}}$, contradicting the conjectured upper bound.

Lower bound proved by Erdős and Gyárfás [Er97b]: for every $r \geq 1$,
there exists a constant $C = C(r) > 1$ such that $R(n; 3, r) > C^{\sqrt{n}}$
for all positive integers $n$.

Generalized Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture [Er97b]: for all $r, k \geq 2$,
there exist constants $C_1, C_2 > 1$ (depending only on $r$) such that
$C_1^{n^{1/(k-1)}} < R(n; k, r) < C_2^{n^{1/(k-1)}}$.
The status of this generalized conjecture is unclear given the issues with
the $k = 3$ upper bound.
