Suppose that we have a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[4n]$ such that $|A|=2n$ for all
$A\in\mathcal{F}$ and for every $A,B\in \mathcal{F}$ we have $|A\cap B| \geq 2$. Then
$$|\mathcal{F}| \leq \frac{1}{2}\left(\binom{4n}{2n}-\binom{2n}{n}^2\right).$$

theorem erdos_83 : answer(True) ↔ ∀ (n : ℕ),
    ∀ (F : Finset (Finset (Fin (4 * n)))),
    (∀ A ∈ F, A.card = 2 * n) →
    (∀ A ∈ F, ∀ B ∈ F, (A ∩ B).card ≥ 2) →
    2 * (F.card : ℝ) ≤ (Nat.choose (4 * n) (2 * n) : ℝ) - (Nat.choose (2 * n) n : ℝ) ^ 2 := by
