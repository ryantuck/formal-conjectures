# Erdős Problem 1092

$f_r(n)$ is maximal such that, if a graph $G$ has the property that every subgraph $H$ on $m$
vertices is the union of a graph with chromatic number $r$ and a graph with $\leq f_r(m)$ edges,
then $G$ has chromatic number $\leq r+1$.

Erdős asked whether $f_2(n) \gg n$ and more generally $f_r(n) \gg rn$.

English version: $f_r(n)$ is maximal such that, if a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has the property that every
subgraph $H$ on $m$ vertices has chromatic number $\leq r+1$ once we remove $f_r(m)$ edges
from it.
