# Erdős Problem 531

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/531](https://www.erdosproblems.com/531)

Let $F(k)$ be the minimal $N$ such that if we two-colour $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ there
is a set $A$ of size $k$ such that all subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$
(for $\emptyset\neq S\subseteq A$) are monochromatic. Estimate $F(k)$.

Originally posed by Erdős [Er73].

The existence of $F(k)$ was established by Sanders and Folkman, and also follows
from Rado's theorem. This is commonly known as Folkman's theorem.

Known lower bounds:
- Erdős–Spencer [ErSp89]: $F(k) \geq 2^{ck^2/\log k}$ for some $c > 0$.
- Balogh–Eberhard–Narayanan–Treglown–Wagner [BENTW17]: $F(k) \geq 2^{2^{k-1}/k}$.

/-- Folkman's theorem: for every $k$, the Folkman number $F(k)$ is finite.
That is, there exists $N$ such that every 2-coloring of $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ has a
monochromatic subset-sum $k$-set. -/

**Erdős Problem 531** (lower bound, [BENTW17]):

$F(k) \geq 2^{2^{k-1}/k}$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

This is the best known lower bound on the Folkman number, due to
Balogh, Eberhard, Narayanan, Treglown, and Wagner.
