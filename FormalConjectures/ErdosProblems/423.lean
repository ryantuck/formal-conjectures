# Erdős Problem 423

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/423](https://www.erdosproblems.com/423)

Let $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$, and for $k \ge 3$ choose $a_k$ to be the least integer
$> a_{k-1}$ which is the sum of at least two consecutive terms of the sequence. What is
the asymptotic behaviour of this sequence?

The sequence begins $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, \ldots$ (OEIS A005243).

Asked by Hofstadter (Erdős says Hofstadter was inspired by a similar question of Ulam).
Bolan and Tang have independently proved that $a_n - n$ is nondecreasing and unbounded,
so there are infinitely many integers not appearing in the sequence.

/-- `IsConsecutiveBlockSum a k m` means that $m$ equals the sum of at least two
    consecutive terms of the sequence $a$, using indices from $\{1, \ldots, k - 1\}$.
    That is, there exist $i, j$ with $1 \le i$, $i + 1 \le j$, $j \le k - 1$ such that
    $m = a(i) + a(i+1) + \cdots + a(j)$. -/

Erdős Problem 423 [Er77c, p.71; ErGr80, p.83]:

Let $a(1) = 1$, $a(2) = 2$, and for $k \ge 3$ let $a(k)$ be the least integer greater
than $a(k-1)$ that is a sum of at least two consecutive terms of the sequence.
Then $a(n) - n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$.

Equivalently, there are infinitely many positive integers not in the range of $a$.
This was proved independently by Bolan and Tang. The full asymptotic behaviour
of the sequence remains an open question.

Erdős Problem 423 — nondecreasing variant [Bolan; Tang]:

The sequence $a(n) - n$ is nondecreasing. This is a stronger structural property than
the unboundedness stated in `erdos_423`, and was also proved independently by Bolan and
Tang.
