# Erdős Problem 342

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/342](https://www.erdosproblems.com/342)

Questions about properties of the Ulam sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, ...): whether
infinitely many pairs $a$, $a + 2$ occur, whether the differences are eventually periodic, and
whether the upper density of the sequence is zero.

Erdős Problem 342, Part 1 [ErGr80, p.53]:

A problem of Ulam. With $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$, let $a_{n+1}$ for $n \geq 2$ be the least
integer $> a_n$ which can be expressed uniquely as $a_i + a_j$ for $i < j \leq n$.
The sequence is $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 26, 28, \ldots$

Do infinitely many pairs $a$, $a + 2$ occur in the sequence?

Erdős Problem 342, Part 2 [ErGr80, p.53]:

Does the Ulam sequence eventually have periodic differences?
That is, do there exist $N$ and $p > 0$ such that
$a(n + p + 1) - a(n + p) = a(n + 1) - a(n)$ for all $n \geq N$?
