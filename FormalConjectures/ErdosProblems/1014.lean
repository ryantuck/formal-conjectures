# Erdős Problem 1014

Erdős conjectured that for fixed $k \geq 3$, the ratio of consecutive Ramsey numbers
$R(k, l+1) / R(k, l)$ tends to $1$ as $l \to \infty$.

See also problems [544] and [1030].

Erdős Problem 1014 [Er71, p.99]:

For fixed $k \geq 3$,
$$\lim_{l \to \infty} R(k, l+1) / R(k, l) = 1,$$
where $R(k, l)$ is the Ramsey number.

Formulated as: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $L_0$ such that for all $l \geq L_0$,
$|R(k, l+1) / R(k, l) - 1| \leq \varepsilon$.
