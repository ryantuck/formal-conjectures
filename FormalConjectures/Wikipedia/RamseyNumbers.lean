# Ramsey numbers

The (graph) Ramsey number $R(k,\ell)$ is the least natural number $n$ such that every simple graph
on $n$ vertices contains either a clique of size $k$ or an independent set of size $\ell$
(equivalently, the complement graph contains a clique of size $\ell$).

We formalize the classical open problem of determining $R(5,5)$, together with the currently best
known bounds $43 \le R(5,5) \le 46$.

Note: the diagonal Ramsey number $R(n,n)$ can also be formulated in terms of 2-colorings of
$2$-subsets, as `Combinatorics.hypergraphRamsey 2 n` (see `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Combinatorics/Ramsey.lean`).

The open problem: determine the Ramsey number $R(5,5)$.

It is known that $43 \le R(5,5) \le 46$.

Lower bound $43 \le R(5,5)$, equivalently: there exists a graph on $42$ vertices with no
$5$-clique and no independent set of size $5$.

Upper bound $R(5,5) \le 46$, i.e. every graph on $46$ vertices contains a $5$-clique or an
independent set of size $5$.

Is $R(5,5) \geq 44$? The current best lower bound is $43$; improving it to $44$
is an open problem.
